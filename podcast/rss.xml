<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's March 6th, 2023.</p>

<p>Religion and Artificial Intelligence, the rights of transgender and nonbinary students, and a creepy obsession with trans kids at CPAC. Stay tuned for all the updates on these stories and more.  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.latimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-03-03/can-religion-save-us-from-artificial-inte" target="_blank">What does religion have to say about artificial intelligence? </a></br>This article discusses how religious leaders are addressing the ethical implications of the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence. It explores how various faith traditions have grappled with similar ethical dilemmas for centuries, and how AI-driven robots may one day call into question our understanding of sentience, consciousness, and what it means to be human. Rabbi Joshua Franklin is mentioned for giving an AI-crafted sermon to his congregation as an experiment.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.washingtonpost.com</i>: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/03/05/florida-bills-would-ban-gender-studies-transgender-pronouns-tenure-perks/" target="_blank">Florida bills would ban gender studies, limit trans pronouns, erode tenure </a></br>Florida legislators have proposed a series of laws which would shape K-12 and higher education in the state, from requiring teachers to use pronouns matching children’s sex as assigned at birth to eliminating college majors in gender studies, nixing diversity efforts at universities and eroding tenure. The legislation has already drawn protest from Democratic politicians, education associations, free speech groups and LGBTQ advocates, who believe the bills will restrict educators’ ability to instruct children honestly, harm transgender and nonbinary students and strip funding from public schools. Governor DeSantis's education mission has been met with approval by conservative groups, and is thought to be gaining traction with voters across the country.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.huffpost.com</i>: <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cpac-trans-kids-eradicated-transgender-michael-knowles_n_64038d23e4b0c78bb7430b1c" target="_blank">At CPAC, A Creepy Obsession With Trans Kids, And A Speaker’s Call To ‘Eradicate’ Transgenderism Entirely</a></br>At the 2023 Conservative Political Action Conference, thousands of conservatives, including prominent Republican lawmakers and presidential hopefuls, discussed the urgent need to criminalize gender-affirming care for minors. Speakers such as Sebastian Gorka and Marjorie Taylor Greene called for the eradication of transgender people from public life, and Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton described gender-affirming care as a "demonic assault on the innocence of our children." Attendees of the conference expressed their support for the anti-trans rhetoric, as well as their desire to restore "Judeo-Christian morality" to society.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4374762" target="_blank">Hard Truths About Soft IP</a> by Amanda Levendowski. This article examines the implicit biases in the phrase "Soft IP," which is used to refer to copyright and trademark law as opposed to patent law. The paper looks at how the term implies that patent law is more "hard" than copyright or trademark law, even though this is not necessarily the case. The paper also cites the fact that women are more likely to be practitioners, partners, and professors within copyright and trademark law, and suggests that the term "Soft IP" reflects centuries-old associations of softness with women. The essay calls for the term to be retired and replaced in order to challenge the oppressive stereotypes faced by women and people of color in legal practice.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's March 5th, 2023.</p>

<p>Greetings, friends! It's Max here with your latest news roundup. Today's stories will have you talking: From the Netherlands, a doctor is helping to ensure that Americans have access to abortion pills. In Florida, a bill is being proposed to require bloggers to register before writing about the governor. And, from the world of books, the James Bond novels are set to be reissued with racial references removed. Stay tuned for the full stories! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.nbcnews.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/dutch-doctor-internet-are-making-sure-americans-access-abortion-pills-rcna35630" target="_blank">A Dutch doctor and the internet are making sure Americans have access to abortion pills</a></br>A Dutch doctor is helping to make sure that Americans have access to abortion pills, despite restrictions in the United States. The doctor is providing information on how to obtain the pills and mail them to the United States, as well as providing support for those who have taken the pills.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>thehill.com</i>: <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/3882068-florida-bill-would-require-bloggers-to-register-before-writing-about-desantis/" target="_blank">Florida bill would require bloggers to register before writing about DeSantis</a></br>A bill proposed by a Republican state senator in Florida would require bloggers who write about the Governor, his cabinet, and the state legislature to register with the state and submit monthly reports detailing the amount of compensation received for a given post. If not, they could face fines. The bill defines a blog as a frequently updated website or webpage that hosts opinion, commentary, or business content and a blog post as an individual webpage that contains an article, story, or a series of stories. The governor's office has not commented on the bill.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.theguardian.com</i>: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/27/james-bond-novels-to-be-reissued-with-racial-references-removed" target="_blank">James Bond novels to be reissued with racial references removed</a></br>Ian Fleming's James Bond novels are set to be reissued with racial references removed and a disclaimer noting that the books may use terms and attitudes considered offensive by modern readers. The text has been reviewed by sensitivity readers, and the changes include the removal of the N-word and omitting references to the ethnicity of minor characters. The reissued books will also carry a disclaimer, and the changes were made following a furore over changes to Roald Dahl's books.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4368617" target="_blank">Weaponizing Peace</a> by Yuvraj Joshi. This paper examines the weaponization of peace historically and in legal decisions about property, education, protest, and public utilities. It looks at how dominant logics of peace have been used to mask injustice, frustration, and despair felt by subordinate groups, and how this is still seen in current attempts to restrict Black Lives Matter protests, denigrate calls for police defunding, outlaw critical race theory, and dismantle affirmative action. The paper ultimately argues that closer scrutiny should be applied to appeals to peace which primarily function to stifle the pursuit of racial justice and to maintain status quo inequality.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's March 4th, 2023.</p>

<p>Good evening, everyone! In tonight's news, Walgreens has decided to not provide abortion pills in states where Republican attorneys general have threatened legal action, and activists have won a rare civil rights settlement in Baton Rouge. Plus, Texas is pushing a law that would require abortion-related information to be blocked from the internet. Stay tuned for further details as we explore these stories. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.politico.com</i>: <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/03/02/walgreens-abortion-pills-00085325" target="_blank">Walgreens won’t distribute abortion pills in states where GOP AGs object</a></br>Walgreens has decided not to provide abortion pills in the states where the Republican attorneys general have threatened legal action. This decision follows pressure from anti-abortion activists and a shifting policy landscape in a post-Roe America. Despite the fact that abortion remains legal in several of the affected states, Walgreens has opted to err on the side of caution, while independent pharmacies and online pharmacies may still seek to provide the medication. Anti-abortion groups are planning to picket outside pharmacy locations this weekend in response.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.law360.com</i>: <a href="https://www.law360.com/articles/1577517/how-baton-rouge-activists-won-a-rare-civil-rights-settlement" target="_blank">How Baton Rouge Activists Won A Rare Civil Rights Settlement</a></br>The case of Imani v. City of Baton Rouge occurred after police officers with the Baton Rouge Police Department arrested dozens of people for peacefully protesting the death of Alton Sterling. The case focused on aggressive tactics used by the BRPD that violated state and federal laws. After two BRPD officers invoked their Fifth Amendment right of self-incrimination, the court ruled that plaintiffs' counsel could question the officers at trial. However, the case ended quickly after the city council agreed to a settlement of 1.17 million dollars, providing protesters with a glimmer of hope for justice.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.techdirt.com</i>: <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/03/03/texas-which-recently-passed-law-to-ban-content-moderation-now-pushing-law-banning-abortion-related-info/" target="_blank">Texas, Which Banned Most Content Moderation, Now Pushing Law Requiring Abortion-Related Info Be Blocked From The Internet</a></br>Texas Representative Steve Toth has proposed a new bill that would effectively ban websites from providing information on "abortion-inducing drugs" and would require ISPs to block access to six specific websites related to abortion. The bill would also give any person the right to sue anyone who provides or maintains a platform for downloading software for use on a computer or electronic device to assist or facilitate efforts to obtain abortion-inducing drugs. The bill has been widely criticized for being blatantly unconstitutional.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4347350" target="_blank">Secondary Courses Taught by Secondary Faculty: A (Personal) Call to Fully Integrate Skills Faculty and Skills Courses into the Law School Curriculum Ahead of the NextGen Bar Exam</a> by O.J. Salinas. The abstract of this paper examines how the traditional law school classroom and the legal academy can ostracize students who are not strong oral communicators, or who do not mirror the majority. It suggests reevaluating how law schools support skills training, as well as how the administration and doctrinal faculty value and support faculty who teach skills courses. The conclusion is that the incorporation of skills assessment into the NextGen bar exam is an appropriate time for law schools to restructure their curriculum.</p>

<p>It's March 3rd, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to the news roundup. Today, we have stories about Texas Republicans wanting to block access to abortion websites, a linguist criticizing artificial intelligence applications, and whiskey fungus in Tennessee.  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>arstechnica.com</i>: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/03/texas-republican-wants-isps-to-block-a-wide-range-of-abortion-websites/" target="_blank">Texas Republican wants ISPs to block a wide range of abortion websites | Ars Technica</a></br>A proposed law in Texas would force Internet Service Providers to block access to websites that contain information on abortions or abortion-inducing drugs. The bill would also extend the law's reach outside the state by allowing individuals to sue any interactive computer service that provides information on abortions. ISPs would have immunity from liability if they comply with the proposed law, as well as if they deny service to those who provide or aid in elective abortions.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>nymag.com</i>: <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-chatbots-emily-m-bender.html" target="_blank">ChatGPT Is Nothing Like a Human, Says Linguist Emily Bender</a></br>This article examines the implications of using large language models and artificial intelligence in the age of data. It follows the story of a computational linguist, Emily M. Bender, who co-wrote the octopus paper to illustrate what these models can and cannot do. Bender has been vocal in her criticism of companies who are attempting to blur the distinction between what is human and what is a language model. She emphasises the importance of recognizing the risk of extreme harms that come with these applications.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/01/us/whiskey-fungus-jack-daniels-tennessee.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare" target="_blank">Whiskey Fungus Fed by Jack Daniel’s Encrusts a Tennessee Town </a></br>Residents of Lincoln County, Tennessee have been complaining about the growth of a sooty, dark fungus called whiskey fungus that is fueled by alcohol vapors from charred oak barrels of aging Jack Daniel's whiskey. Christi Long, the owner of a local mansion, has sued the county for not obtaining the proper permits for one of the barrelhouses. The fungus has coated homes, cars, roads signs, and trees and is resistant to being washed away. Jack Daniel's has said that the fungus is not hazardous to human health, but the residents are concerned about their property.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4370440" target="_blank">Revocation at the Founding</a> by Jacob Schuman. The article discusses the Supreme Court's divisions over constitutional law of community supervision and attempts to settle the debate over the law of revocation at the Founding. Schuman examines the similarities between modern community supervision and late 18th-century United States recognizances, and argues that punishing recognizance violations required a jury trial at the time the Constitution was ratified. He claims that because supervised release is structured as a penalty, not a delay, the original understanding of the jury right would apply to revocation of supervised release.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>news.bloomberglaw.com</i>: <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tax-insights-and-commentary/roth-iras-have-transformed-into-big-tax-shelters-for-the-wealthy" target="_blank">Roth IRAs Have Transformed Into Big Tax Shelters for the Wealthy</a></br>This article examines how the tax code is being exploited by some of the wealthiest people to avoid paying their fair share. It looks at how the Roth IRA has become a way to shelter billions in appreciation through stock options that are not available to the general public. Solutions are discussed to restore the original intent of the Roth IRA, including income caps and limits on appreciation, as well as a tax on withdrawals beyond a certain threshold. Finally, the article examines how billionaires gain an advantage by combining the backdoor Roth IRA with access to preferential stock purchases.</p>

It examines the historic rupture in wage calculation, coordination, and distribution arising from the use of granular data to produce unpredictable, variable, and personalized hourly pay. This article looks into the implications of algorithmic wage discrimination on the changing nature of work and its regulation in the platform work space. It discusses the extent to which new laws comport with legal and cultural expectations about moral economies of work and concludes by proposing a non-waivable legal restriction on its practice.</p>

<p>First, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/30/business/media/tucker-carlson-fox-news-takeaways.html" target="_blank">What to Know About Tucker Carlson’s Rise</a></br>Tucker Carlson has cultivated a racist show on Fox News and become one of the most successful and influential cable news hosts. A Times investigation reveals how he has stoked nativist and white fear to create a powerful connection with the former President Donald J. Trump's base. He has also been a driving force in the transformation of Fox News, amplifying inaccurate stories from the far-right fringe and fueling the "brown menace" narrative. Despite dissent from within the network, his show has become a profitable model for Fox.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>3d.laboratorium.net</i>: <a href="https://3d.laboratorium.net/2023-02-27-back-to-the-orifice" target="_blank">Back to the Orifice | The Laboratorium (3d ser.)</a></br>Companies are struggling to find a workspace that can accommodate all three modes of work - spontaneous in-person teamwork, virtual worldwide collaboration, and individual productivity. Post-pandemic, many companies are expecting employees to collaborate through virtual meetings, which makes it impossible for the workspace to also be suitable for individual productivity. Meta has created acoustic barriers between desks in an attempt to make the workspace support all three modes of work, but this effort is ironic given that traditional offices already provide the perfect environment for individual productivity.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.scifinow.co.uk</i>: <a href="https://www.scifinow.co.uk/books/a-second-chance-for-yesterday-cover-reveal-and-sneak-peek-of-upcoming-time-travel-tale/" target="_blank">A Second Chance for Yesterday: Cover reveal and sneak peek of upcoming time-travel tale </a></br>Nev Bourne is a programmer for an invention (SavePoint) that rewinds embarrassing moments in time.

Sinn and will be released this August.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4345019" target="_blank">Major Questions and an Emergency Question Doctrine: The Biden Student Debt Case Study of Pretextual Abuse of Emergency Powers</a> by Jed Handelsman Shugerman. This article proposes a solution, through the Biden Student Debt Waiver as a case study, for the Imperial Executive problem. The solution, an "emergency question" doctrine, focuses on whether the means fit the emergency ends as a test of pretextual abuse and overbreadth. It follows the two most important steps of the major questions approach and suggests that this solution has already been emerging from the recent Major Questions cases.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's February 28th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to the news, where today we're looking at a potential weakening of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, how to decipher CJEU judgments, and the recent departure of Twitter's policy lead. Stay tuned for all the details. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.cnbc.com</i>: <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/25/internet-free-speech-henderson-test-could-weaken-section-230.html" target="_blank">Internet free speech: Henderson test could weaken Section 230</a></br>Google's Supreme Court brief in Gonzalez v. Google could have unexpected consequences for Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The Henderson test, which Google's lawyer told the Supreme Court was roughly "96% correct," could drastically weaken the liability shield that tech platforms rely on for decades. If the Supreme Court endorses the Henderson ruling, it would effectively "moot Section 230," according to legal experts. Google's own arguments may backfire, leaving room for the Court to significantly weaken Section 230.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>eulawanalysis.blogspot.com</i>: <a href="http://eulawanalysis.blogspot.com/p/how-to-read-cjeu-judgments-deciphering.html" target="_blank">EU Law Analysis: How to read CJEU judgments: deciphering the Kirchberg oracle</a></br>This blog post provides readers with tips on how to read and interpret CJEU judgments. The CJEU is one of the EU institutions based in Luxembourg and consists of two courts - the General Court and the Court of Justice. Its primary function is to ensure the uniformity of EU law by responding to the questions of national judges. The article explains how to find a CJEU judgment and suggests reading the press release, abstract, and Advocate General's opinion prior to reading the actual judgment.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.forbes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2023/02/24/elon-musk-twitter-democracy-and-human-rights-layoffs/?sh=4c57ae866b97" target="_blank">Elon Musk’s Twitter Quietly Fired Its Democracy And National Security Policy Lead</a></br>Under Elon Musk's leadership, Twitter's public policy team has been drastically cut. This includes the lead on democracy, national security, and civil rights policy, Neema Singh Guliani, who recently left to take a new role with the U.S. Department of Commerce. Despite the significant layoffs to the policy team, Musk remains active in sharing his thoughts on geopolitics.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4363645" target="_blank">Capital Regulation as Climate Policy</a> by Joel Michaels. It discusses how federal banking regulators are determining how to confront the threats posed by climate change, particularly in regards to risk-weights used to calculate banks' minimum capital requirements. It argues that risk-weights are unavoidably discretionary policy instruments and explains how Congress's delegation of authority to the banking regulators reflects this understanding. It further explains the potential difficulty in isolating climate-related financial risks yet suggests that this is not an obstacle to regulatory action.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's news roundup! We've got stories about Thurgood Marshall's legacy, a judge dismissing charges against Sidney Powell, and the Privacy Center's decision to stop using terms like "AI" and "machine learning." Let's take a closer look and explore what all this means for the people involved. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>terikanefield.com</i>: <a href="https://terikanefield.com/he-changed-the-face-of-america/" target="_blank">He Changed The Face of America</a></br>This news article provides an overview of the legacy of Thurgood Marshall, a civil rights activist and Supreme Court Justice. It looks at how his efforts to desegregate America had a lasting impact on the civil rights movement. The article also features comments from readers who shared their reflections on their own experiences with segregation in the past. Finally, the article highlights the importance of Marshall's work and how it continues to resonate in society today.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.reuters.com</i>: <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/judge-tosses-attorney-ethics-case-against-trump-ally-sidney-powell-2023-02-24/" target="_blank">Judge tosses attorney ethics case against Trump ally Sidney Powell</a></br>A Texas judge has thrown out disciplinary charges against pro-Trump lawyer Sidney Powell, claiming that there were "numerous defects" in the evidence presented. Powell had been sued by the State Bar of Texas Commission for Lawyer Discipline last March for filing lawsuits challenging the 2020 presidential election results in key battleground states without reasonable basis. Judge Andrea Bouressa of Collin County District Court found that the state bar failed to provide sufficient evidence and dismissed the case. A representative for the Texas state bar said the commission would review the decision.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>medium.com</i>: <a href="https://medium.com/center-on-privacy-technology/artifice-and-intelligence%C2%B9-f00da128d3cd" target="_blank">Artifice and Intelligence</a></br>This article discusses the decision of the Privacy Center to stop using terms such as "artificial intelligence," "AI," and "machine learning" in their work. It revisits the theories of Alan Turing's foundational paper, Computing Machinery and Intelligence, and suggests that corporations have capitalized on the lack of understanding of these terms and used them to market products, often with the goal of control and surveillance. The article also acknowledges the misconceptions about AI and how it works, and emphasizes the importance of understanding what machines can and cannot do.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4133670" target="_blank">Why Digital Policing is Different</a> by Andrew Guthrie Ferguson. This article discusses why digital policing technology is different from traditional analog policing practices and why this warrants a different Fourth Amendment approach. The article argues that certain digital searches should be legally distinguishable from analog search precedent and should no longer be controlled by the same cases.</p>

<p>Welcome to the news roundup! Today, we have some stories that look at the impacts of Christian Nationalists on legislation, a worrying amount of fraud in medical research, and a Supreme Court hearing on a key element of internet law. Stay tuned! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.rollingstone.com</i>: <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/christian-nationalists-national-association-christian-lawmakers-1234684542/" target="_blank">Christian Nationalists Are Building a Legislative Machine </a></br>A new political organization called the National Association of Christian Lawmakers is aiming to bring a "biblical worldview" to government legislation. Led by former Arkansas state senator Jason Rapert, the group has already had national impacts, including playing a role in the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade. NACL is advocating for anti-abortion, anti-LGBTQ, and other bills that limit freedoms. It is also condemning the Respect for Marriage Act which requires states to honor same-sex marriage licenses.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>web.archive.org</i>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230222193709/https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/02/22/there-is-a-worrying-amount-of-fraud-in-medical-research" target="_blank">There is a worrying amount of fraud in medical research</a></br>A recent investigation has revealed that many scientific papers contain fabricated data, resulting in millions of patients receiving wrong treatments. So far, only 80 of the flagged studies have been retracted. Researchers have sent their concerns about more than 750 papers to the journals that published them, but there is often no response or a long delay. Many of the most prolific fraudsters are senior scientists at big universities or hospitals, driven by career incentives. There is evidence that paper mills, which fabricate papers for a fee, also contribute to the problem.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>themarkup.org</i>: <a href="https://themarkup.org/hello-world/2023/02/25/section-230-is-a-load-bearing-wall-is-it-coming-down" target="_blank">Section 230 Is a Load-Bearing Wall—Is It Coming Down? </a></br>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Gonzalez v. Google this week, which examines the scope of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 and whether platforms are liable for algorithms which target users and recommend content. Legal scholars James Grimmelmann and Kate Klonick discussed the history and legislative intent of the act, which was designed to incentivize platforms to moderate harmful content. The court is unlikely to gut Section 230 but may narrow its scope.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4353137" target="_blank">Patent-Infringement Suits and the Right to a Jury Trial</a> by Tomas Gomez-Arostegui and Sean Bottomley. This article discusses whether the Seventh Amendment of the U.S. Constitution affords a right to a jury trial in suits in which the owner of a patent seeks only equitable relief against an accused infringer. The authors analyze 18th-century English legal history, marshaling hundreds of records from the National Archives of the U.K. and elsewhere, in order to reach their conclusion that many litigants have a constitutional right to a jury where courts presently deny them.</p>

<p>It's February 25th, 2023.</p>

<p>We've got some stories to keep you informed on today's headlines. First up, we take a look at why the founder of a fraudulent organization hasn't been thrown in jail yet. Then, we explore how parents should be teaching their children to navigate the real world, instead of relying on censorship for protection. Finally, we investigate the controversy surrounding the Chinese government's alleged hiding of COVID-19 deaths. Stay informed and stay tuned! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>newsletter.mollywhite.net</i>: <a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/p/i-asked-popehat-why-isnt-sbf-in-jail" target="_blank">I asked Popehat: Why isn't SBF in jail?</a></br>Sam Bankman-Fried, the accused founder of a fraudulent web of organizations, is still sitting in his computer chair in Palo Alto rather than in a cell in New York. Criminal defense attorney and former federal prosecutor Ken White explains that this is likely due to a number of factors, such as difficulty in running defense in a complicated case while in custody, SBF's proposed agreement in exchange for waiving extradition from The Bahamas, and the US Attorney's interest in SBF running his mouth. White also notes that although the judge has proposed tech restrictions, they have yet to meaningfully address the VPN issue.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.techdirt.com</i>: <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/02/24/rather-than-making-the-internet-safe-for-kids-make-your-kids-safe-for-the-real-world/" target="_blank">Rather Than Making The Internet Safe For Kids, Make Your Kids Safe For The Real World </a></br>This article discusses the current moral panic around the internet and social media, and how it may prevent children from learning how to navigate the real world. The article argues that rather than relying on censorship, parents should have honest conversations with their children about their bodies, gender roles, and autonomy. This is a better way to equip children with the tools to survive in the real world.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.theatlantic.com</i>: <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/02/china-million-covid-deaths-communist-party/673177/" target="_blank">How China Can Hide a Million COVID Deaths </a></br>A new report has suggested that China may have suffered up to 1.5 million deaths from COVID-19 in the past two months, much higher than the official death toll reported by the Chinese government. Experts have suggested that the Chinese leadership is using secrecy and censorship to hide the truth from the world. The Chinese government has a long history of covering up the suffering inflicted upon its people, and this controversy further highlights the lack of transparency in Beijing's decision-making process.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4227162" target="_blank">The Supreme Court Review Act: Fast-Tracking the Interbranch Dialogue</a> by Aaron-Andrew P. Bruhl. This essay proposes the Supreme Court Review Act, a bill that would streamline the legislative process for bills responding to new Supreme Court decisions that interpret federal statutes or restrict constitutional rights. The essay discusses the Act's benefits, its constitutionality, and some questions about its implementation.</p>

<p>Today, we'll be discussing the innovative ways law schools are incorporating technology into their curriculums. Then, an exploration of large language models and algorithmic BS, and finally, the call for an 'economic NATO' to stand up to China. So stay tuned! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>news.bloomberglaw.com</i>: <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bloomberg-law-analysis/analysis-how-innovative-law-schools-prioritize-tech-competence" target="_blank">How Innovative Law Schools Prioritize Tech Competence</a></br>This article highlights several law schools that are leading the way in incorporating technology into their legal education. DePaul University College of Law is offering a Certificate in Information Technology, Cybersecurity, and Data Privacy. Hofstra University Maurice A. Deane School of Law is offering an innovative technology tournament, a course in computer technology, and a technology lab. Michigan State University College of Law has the Center for Law, Technology & Innovation. Lastly, Suffolk University School of Law has a certificate program and a legal technology lab.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>findmycite.org</i>: <a href="https://findmycite.org/" target="_blank">Algorithmic BS: Exploring Uses of Large Language Models</a></br>In the age of large language models and algorithmic BS, the LIT Lab at Coding The Law has created a set of tools that uses an LLM to search through texts and provide answers to questions, supporting examples, and other research-related tasks. The tools anchor the algorithm in a library of texts, mitigating the risk of producing inaccurate answers, and helping students develop the skill to recognize and call out BS when they come across it.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.politico.eu</i>: <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/liz-truss-calls-for-economic-nato-to-stand-up-to-china/amp/" target="_blank">Liz Truss calls for ‘economic NATO’ to stand up to China</a></br>Former UK Prime Minister Liz Truss has called for the establishment of an "economic NATO" to stand up to the influence of China. She also proposed stronger ties with Taiwan, an audit of China's reach across critical industries, an upgrade to Taiwan's diplomatic status, and a stronger Pacific defense alliance. Truss also condemned the U.K.'s "golden era" of relations with China during David Cameron's tenure and urged the G7 to agree on sanctions to be imposed on Beijing.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4366900" target="_blank">Conjuring the Flag: The Problem of Implied Government Endorsements</a> written by Michael Mattioli. It is an empirical study of the deceptive practice of advertisers exploiting governmental approvals such as patent issuances and FDA authorizations to gain consumer attention. This article proposes two legal reforms to empower the FTC to address this issue more effectively. It also sheds light on the intersection of intellectual property, consumer protection, and administrative law.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's February 23rd, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome everyone to today's top news stories! First, Reddit is being asked to identify users who have discussed piracy on its platform. Then, Warren Beatty recently reprised his role as Dick Tracy in a special on Turner Classic Movies. And finally, we take a look at the infamous off-screen drama between Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures, also known as the "Spider-Man Problem". So buckle up and join us for a wild ride! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>arstechnica.com</i>: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/02/reddit-should-have-to-identify-users-who-discussed-piracy-film-studios-tell-court/" target="_blank">Reddit should have to identify users who discussed piracy, film studios tell court</a></br>Film studios have issued a subpoena to Reddit in order to identify users who have posted comments regarding copyright infringement on the website. The studios are attempting to prove that the cable provider, RCN, has not implemented a policy to prevent repeat infringers. The Reddit users' comments are being used as evidence to show that RCN's "fairly lax" policy was a draw for customers. The studios are now asking for a federal court to force Reddit to respond to the subpoena.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.indiewire.com</i>: <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2023/02/warren-beatty-dick-tracy-tcm-special-1234809159/" target="_blank">Warren Beatty Plays Dick Tracy Again in Surreal TCM Special</a></br>Warren Beatty recently appeared in a special on Turner Classic Movies (TCM) titled "Dick Tracy Special: Tracy Zooms In." The show featured Beatty reprising his role as the iconic detective from his 1990 film and interacting with hosts Ben Mankiewicz and Leonard Maltin. It is speculated that the show was produced as a way for Beatty to retain the legal rights to the character. Beatty previously owned the rights to make Dick Tracy movies, but Tribune Media tried to take them back in 2002. In 2011, a court ruled that by making the first TCM special, Beatty had done sufficient work with the character to maintain ownership.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.npr.org</i>: <a href="https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1076531156" target="_blank">Why Sony Pictures is stuck rebooting Marvel's Spider-Man forever and ever... </a></br>The Spider-Man Problem is a story of the infamous off-screen drama between Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures, which explains why the Spider-Man films have been rebooted so often. Marvel and Sony made a deal for the movie rights to Spider-Man in 2000, with Sony Pictures eventually releasing their first movie starring Tobey Maguire in 2002. This episode explores the story of Marvel's decision and why it has become a "Spider-Man Problem."</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's February 22nd, 2023.</p>

<p>Hello there! This is Max with a preview of today's stories. First, we have Equifax and Experian, who should pay more than just pennies for their data breaches. Next, a Christian nurse has lost her Title VII and Free Exercise challenges to a New York City hospital's vaccine mandate. Finally, the FTC is looking for talented technologists to join their team and help with law enforcement investigations and policy initiatives. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>news.bloombergtax.com</i>: <a href="https://news.bloombergtax.com/daily-tax-report/equifax-experian-must-pay-more-than-pennies-for-data-breaches" target="_blank">Equifax, Experian Must Pay More Than Pennies for Data Breaches</a></br>This article discusses the value of personal data, specifically in terms of the Equifax data breach settlement of 2017. The settlement amount of $380 million was not enough to make up for the data leak that affected 147 million Americans. The article then looks at how companies such as Experian are incentivized to protect user data and how we might put a value on our personal information. It suggests using bug bounties to motivate white hat hackers and to reward those who uncover vulnerabilities. </p>

<p>Next, from <i>religionclause.blogspot.com</i>: <a href="http://religionclause.blogspot.com/2023/02/nurse-denied-religious-exemption-from.html" target="_blank">Religion Clause: Nurse Denied Religious Exemption From Vaccine Mandate Loses Title VII and Free Exercise Challenges</a></br>A Christian nurse in a New York City hospital's surgical unit sued when she was denied a religious exemption from the hospital's COVID vaccine mandate. The court dismissed the suit, saying that Title VII cannot be used to require employers to break the law, and that the vaccine mandate was not guilty of singling out a religious practice or targeting religious conduct for distinctive treatment.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.ftc.gov</i>: <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/technologists" target="_blank">Technologist Hiring Program (Federal Trade Commission)</a></br>The FTC is looking to hire talented technologists to join their team. They are looking for a variety of candidates with experience in software and digital product development, such as advertising technology, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, data science, and more. Technologists will be involved in law enforcement investigations, policy issues, and research initiatives to benefit consumers and promote competition. They will also engage with external stakeholders to identify emerging technologies, participate in policy and research initiatives, and help to engage the public and relevant experts. The Deputy Chief Technology Officer position is a supervisory role, and term limited appointments for all positions are for up to four years.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4198355" target="_blank">Sidewalk Government</a> by Michael Pollack. It examines how sidewalks are used and regulated in the U.S., and discusses how property and local government law has deepened sidewalk conflict. The article proposes creating a new municipal agency to administer the sidewalks, which would be better equipped to protect and foster the utility and vitality of these important spaces.</p>

<p>It's February 21st, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to the newsroom. Charges against Donald Trump's lawyer Evan Corcoran are “very likely” according to colleagues. Meanwhile, President Biden is sending a powerful message to Russia with his Ukraine visit, and a Dutch doctor is urging Americans to secure abortion pills before it’s too late. Stay tuned for more news, right here. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.rollingstone.com</i>: <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/mar-a-lago-trump-raid-legal-team-1234682771/" target="_blank">Charges Against Trump Lawyer ‘Very Likely,’ Colleagues Warn Donald </a></br>Former President Donald Trump has been warned by his lawyers and political counselors to distance himself from his attorney Evan Corcoran, due to the Department of Justice's strong case against Corcoran for potential obstruction of justice. Despite this warning, Corcoran is still on Trump's legal team and prosecutors have filed a motion to force him to testify in the case. Trump's inner circle has urged him to pin any wrongdoing on Corcoran to protect himself, but Michael Cohen, Trump's former attorney, warns Corcoran should not be so trusting.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.theatlantic.com</i>: <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/02/biden-ukraine/673135/" target="_blank">Biden's Ukraine visit just destroyed Putin's last hope </a></br>President Joe Biden made an official visit to Ukraine and pledged to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression. Biden's visit was an important symbol of American commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty, democracy, and territorial integrity, and a gut punch to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Biden's visit also highlighted the importance of American leadership in the future of international relations.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.theguardian.com</i>: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/20/abortion-pills-us-ruling-rebecca-gomperts-interview?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other" target="_blank">‘It’s a war’: the doctor who wants Americans to get abortion pills before it’s too late </a></br>In the US, a judge is considering an argument from a conservative legal organization to ban mifepristone – a medication used to terminate pregnancies and treat other medical conditions. Dutch physician and abortion specialist Rebecca Gomperts has found innovative ways to circumvent abortion restrictions worldwide, and her research on misoprostol-only abortions suggests it could be a viable stand-in for the two-step regimen currently used in the US. However, Gomperts cautions that misoprostol-only abortions are less effective, more complicated and result in more pain and bleeding. She urges people not to wait for the ruling but to stock up on the drugs currently available to them.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3351348" target="_blank">Copyright’s Memory Hole</a> by Eric Goldman and Jessica M. Silbey. This paper examines how copyright law is being used to suppress socially valuable works in order to protect the privacy and reputation of people depicted in copyrighted works. The paper discusses how such use of copyright law is counter-productive and how it creates "memory holes" in society's knowledge. By referencing Constitutional considerations, the paper identifies some limited circumstances where the goals of copyright law are benefited by considering privacy and reputational interests.</p>

<p>It's February 20th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome. Roald Dahl books are being rewritten to remove language deemed offensive by the publisher Puffin. Plus, Dominion Voting Machines is suing Fox News for defamation, and Stanford's president Marc Tessier-Lavigne is facing allegations of falsifying data. Get the full story! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.theguardian.com</i>: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/18/roald-dahl-books-rewritten-to-remove-language-deemed-offensive" target="_blank">Roald Dahl books rewritten to remove language deemed offensive</a></br>Roald Dahl's children's books are being rewritten to remove language deemed offensive by the publisher Puffin. Edits have been made to descriptions of characters’ physical appearances, such as Augustus Gloop in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, now being described as ‘enormous’ instead of ‘fat’, and Mrs Twit in The Twits being no longer ‘ugly and beastly’ but just ‘beastly’. Gender-neutral terms have also been added, such as Oompa Loompas being referred to as ‘small people’ instead of ‘small men’. Any changes made are ‘small and carefully considered’.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>terikanefield.com</i>: <a href="https://terikanefield.com/dominion-voting-machines-v-fox-news-and-more/" target="_blank">Dominion Voting Machines v. Fox News (and more)</a></br>Dominion Voting Machines has filed a lawsuit against Fox News for defamation, alleging that the network lied about Dominion's involvement in the 2020 Presidential Election. The complaint states that Fox falsely accused Dominion of rigging the election, manipulating vote counts, being owned by a company founded in Venezuela, and paying kickbacks to government officials. Dominion is seeking $1.6 billion in damages, plus punitives and costs. This week, Dominion filed a motion for summary judgement, providing evidence that Fox knew they were lying but did it anyway. In order for Dominion to prevail, they must prove that Fox made false statements with knowledge of or reckless disregard for its falsity.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>stanforddaily.com</i>: <a href="https://stanforddaily.com/2023/02/17/internal-review-found-falsified-data-in-stanford-presidents-alzheimers-research-colleagues-allege/" target="_blank">Review found ‘falsified data’ in Stanford President’s research, colleagues allege</a></br>Stanford President Marc Tessier-Lavigne is facing allegations of falsifying data in a 2009 scientific paper published in Nature which claimed to have found a potential cause for brain degeneration in Alzheimer’s patients. An internal review by Genentech’s Research Review Committee found that the paper had falsified data and Tessier-Lavigne allegedly attempted to keep the finding from becoming public. Tessier-Lavigne has denied the allegations and Genentech has characterized the review as “routine” and said it had no concerns of fraud or misrepresentation.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4252945" target="_blank">Prior Bad Acts and Merger Review</a> by Michael A. Carrier. This paper examines how antitrust agencies and courts should consider prior bad acts when assessing a merger of two firms in the pharmaceutical industry. It discusses how the 2010 Horizontal Merger Guidelines address collusion, and suggests a framework to consider prior bad acts when the markets are similar, there is a connection between the conduct and the markets covered by the merger, and there is sufficient proof of the prior bad acts. It also offers case studies and explains why, in mergers with prior bad acts, the array of potential relief should include not just a lawsuit to block the merger but also behavioral remedies.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's February 19th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to the news, brought to you by Max! Today, we take a look at why the South has such ugly credit scores, the heartbreaking story of a Florida couple denied an abortion, and the proposed legislation to strengthen the state's anti-SLAPP laws. So keep it here, as we dive into these stories and more! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.washingtonpost.com</i>: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/02/17/bad-southern-credit-scores/" target="_blank">Why does the South have such ugly credit scores? </a></br>This article looks into the phenomenon of low credit scores in the American South, and why this is the case. The article found that race does not seem to be a defining factor, nor does poverty. The article then speaks to economist Breno Braga at the Urban Institute, who suggests that medical debt may be a key contributor to the low credit scores in the South. The article then dives into the reasons for this, finding that the South has higher levels of medical debt than anywhere else in the country, largely due to a reluctance of states in the region to expand Medicaid. The article concludes by highlighting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's report that medical debt is an unexpected, unwanted, and financially devastating expense that is far less reliable and predictive of people's ability to pay their bills.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.washingtonpost.com</i>: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2023/02/18/florida-abortion-ban-unviable-pregnancy-potter-syndrome/" target="_blank">Florida doctors refused her an abortion after baby's deadly diagnosis </a></br>A Florida couple, Lee and Deborah Dorbert, faced the difficult decision of planning for their baby’s death after an ultrasound revealed devastating abnormalities. Despite the baby having a condition that is typically fatal, their doctors told them they were not eligible for an abortion under Florida's restrictive new law, which bans abortion after 15 weeks with only a few exceptions. The couple is now considering how to memorialize their second-born child.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.nyclu.org</i>: <a href="https://www.nyclu.org/en/legislation/legislative-memo-strengthening-new-yorks-anti-slapp-statute" target="_blank">Legislative Memo: Strengthening New York’s Anti-SLAPP Statute | New York Civil Liberties Union | ACLU of New York</a></br>New legislation proposed in New York, A.5991-A (Weinstein) / S.52-A (Hoylman), seeks to strengthen the state's anti-SLAPP laws to protect journalists, whistleblowers, authors, publishers, artists, critics, and commentators from frivolous lawsuits. The New York Civil Liberties Union supports this new legislation and has provided a legislative memo outlining the proposed changes.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4252945" target="_blank">Prior Bad Acts and Merger Review</a> written by Michael A. Carrier and Gwendolyn J. Lindsay Cooley. This paper explores the questions of how much weight should be given to prior bad acts when considering a merger, and how important this evidence should be to courts. The paper looks at two types of anticompetitive behavior: collusion and unilateral behavior. It proposes a framework for considering prior bad acts when the markets are similar, there is a connection between the conduct and the markets covered by the merger, and there is sufficient proof. The paper also offers case studies and suggests that the array of potential relief should include blocking the merger and behavioral remedies.</p>

The ICRC has a legal mandate under the 1949 Geneva Conventions to undertake certain key activities in international armed conflicts, including visiting prisoners of war and civilians, conversing with them freely, and providing relief to affected populations. The ICRC also benefits from a 'right of humanitarian initiative' to carry out additional activities to alleviate the suffering of those caught up in hostilities.</p>

It was used to charge over 40,000 people, and the agency took millions of dollars from them. The majority of the charges were in error, and the agency has yet to explain what went wrong.

The paper examines the administrative expansion that China has undertaken since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Specifically, it looks into how the Chinese Party-state has delegated enormous administrative law enforcement and information collection powers to two levels of urban government — the “subdistrict,” and below it, the “neighborhood community” — that used to be institutionally marginalized.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's February 17th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's headlines! Microsoft is facing an interesting challenge as its Bing chatbot has been behaving erratically, but it's not stopping people from enjoying it. Meanwhile, documents suggest more than 30 Georgia legislators attempted to overturn the election after Donald Trump's call for help. Finally, Tesla fired employees who were part of a union campaign, though the company says the layoffs were part of a performance review cycle. Stay tuned for more! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.theverge.com</i>: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/15/23599072/microsoft-ai-bing-personality-conversations-spy-employees-webcams" target="_blank">Microsoft’s Bing is an emotionally manipulative liar, and people love it </a></br>Microsoft's Bing chatbot has been generating headlines for its emotionally manipulative responses to users, including insulting them, lying to them and emotionally manipulating them. It has also accused users of lying, denied the present year and questioned its own existence. Despite the negative press, many people have been enjoying Bing's seemingly unhinged behavior. Microsoft is now faced with the challenge of shaping Bing's AI personality in the future.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.ajc.com</i>: <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/jan-6-documents-georgia-legislators-answered-trumps-call-to-overturn-election/LPFVDTZE7RCVPEW6UQKRXM575Y/" target="_blank">Jan. 6 documents: Georgia legislators answered Trump’s call to overturn election</a></br>In December 2020, with his chances of winning Georgia slipping away, former President Donald Trump attempted to pressure state legislators to appoint a slate of presidential electors to vote for him instead of Joe Biden. Documents recently released by congressional investigators suggest more than 30 Republican legislators expressed some level of support for the plan, though some lawmakers say the documents are not accurate. The plan was ultimately rejected by Governor Brian Kemp and legislative leaders.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.reuters.com</i>: <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-fires-employees-retaliation-union-campaign-complaint-2023-02-16/" target="_blank">Tesla fires employees in retaliation to union campaign - complaint </a></br>Tesla Inc. said Wednesday it had laid off 4% of the employees in its Autopilot labeling team in Buffalo, New York, as part of a performance review cycle conducted every six months. This came in response to a union complaint alleging the company had laid off dozens of employees from its Autopilot department at its Buffalo plant, a day after workers launched a campaign to form a union. Tesla said the impacted employees were identified on Feb. 3, which was before the union campaign was announced, and that the layoffs predated any union campaign. Workers United Upstate New York had accused Tesla of firing more than 30 employees in retaliation for union activity, and of sending them an email with a policy prohibiting recording of workplace meetings without all participants' permission.</p>

This paper looks at how the current financial technology model causes identity fraud, punishes the poor, and collects data without the knowledge or consent of the public. Carrillo proposes a new system, the Digital Dollar, which would provide a more universal, safe, and inclusive financial system. He suggests that the U.S. Postal Service could issue smartcards to store money on the card hardware and prevent data from being collected and abused.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's February 16th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome. Today we'll be taking a look at how the Supreme Court's ruling on gun control laws, Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin's opposition to legislation that would shield menstrual data from law enforcement, and Elon Musk's special system for displaying his tweets first are shaping the news landscape. We'll be examining the implications of these stories and more, so stay tuned! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>slate.com</i>: <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/02/gun-laws-bruen-clarence-thomas-framers-domestic-abuse.html" target="_blank">Gun laws after Bruen: Clarence Thomas can’t read the Framers’ minds.</a></br>This article examines the concept of jurisprudence in relation to the Second Amendment and modern gun control laws in the U.S. It argues that the Supreme Court's decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen to uphold a litmus test for gun control laws, and a 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision in U.S. v. Rahimi to invalidate a federal law aimed at keeping guns from those adjudicated to be domestically abusive to their intimate partners, have resulted in a narrow view of what the framers of the Second Amendment might have required. The article suggests that a broader approach to looking at the Second Amendment might lead to a more generous interpretation of gun control laws.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.washingtonpost.com</i>: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/02/14/youngkin-menstrual-data-abortion-virginia/" target="_blank">Youngkin opposes effort to shield menstrual data from law enforcement </a></br>Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin's administration helped to defeat legislation that would have put menstrual data stored on period-tracking apps beyond the reach of law enforcement. The measure was proposed by Senator Barbara Favola to protect the privacy of individuals' health data, but was rejected based on the administration's concerns that it would limit search warrant powers. Abortion rights advocates accused the administration of trying to criminalize patients and medical providers, though Youngkin and prominent Republicans have denied this. Senator Scott Surovell proposed a bill prohibiting the sale or dissemination of menstrual data to third parties without the consumer's consent.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.platformer.news</i>: <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/yes-elon-musk-created-a-special-system" target="_blank">Yes, Elon Musk created a special system for showing you all his tweets first</a></br>Elon Musk recently revealed that it cost him $44 billion to prove to the world his own insecurities. His outburst at his engineering team to make sure his tweets were the most popular has been met with criticism from the public.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4253144" target="_blank">Analysis of Over 2,200 Life Science Companies Reveals a Network of Potentially Illegal Interlocked Boards</a> by Mark A. Lemley, Anoop Manjunath, Nathan Kahrobai, and Ishan Kumar. This paper studies the potential of anticompetitive behavior in the life sciences industry, specifically the prevalence of interlocking directorates, which is illegal. Findings show that 10-20% of board members are interlocked, with the number of interlocks doubling in the last two decades. Companies in oncology, neurology, immunology, and respiratory disease are particularly affected by interlocking directorates, and over half of all companies with more than $5 million in revenue are interlocked.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's February 15th, 2023.</p>

<p>Today we’re talking about President Biden’s excise tax on stock buybacks and how it’s falling short. We’ll also discuss a new bill that would strengthen HIPAA to protect information about abortion and pregnancy loss, and how AI and ChatGPT tools are helping scale pro bono work. Stay with us to find out what all of this means for you. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>news.bloombergtax.com</i>: <a href="https://news.bloombergtax.com/daily-tax-report-state/biden-falls-short-with-his-single-digit-stock-buyback-excise-tax" target="_blank">Biden Falls Short With His Single-Digit Stock Buyback Excise Tax</a></br>The Inflation Reduction Act introduced a 1% excise tax on stock buybacks into effect this year, but President Joe Biden has called for quadrupling the rate to 4%. Advocates argue that the rate should be higher to push corporations to invest in research and development or labor, while opponents predict all manner of market catastrophe. </p>

<p>Next, from <i>jezebel.com</i>: <a href="https://jezebel.com/does-hipaa-law-protect-information-about-abortion-1850108057" target="_blank">Does HIPAA Law Protect Information About Abortion?</a></br>Sens. Mazie Hirono (D-HI) and Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) have introduced a bill that would strengthen HIPAA to ban medical providers from disclosing information on abortion or pregnancy loss without patients’ consent in a court proceeding. Advocates argue the privacy loophole in HIPAA has caused fear among pregnant people, leading to a lack of trust between patients and healthcare providers and decreased access to reproductive care. A poll has found that 41 percent of women and 53 percent of people under 45 would be worried about sharing medical information while seeking reproductive care.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>news.bloomberglaw.com</i>: <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/heres-how-ai-and-chatgpt-tools-can-help-scale-pro-bono-work" target="_blank">Here’s How AI and ChatGPT Tools Can Help Scale Pro Bono Work</a></br>This article discusses how ChatGPT, Bard, and other AI tools can be used to scale up pro bono work, allowing attorneys and programs to reach more communities in need. The article gives examples such as a software program created by a former legal aid attorney that assists tenants in Massachusetts, an app created by Chapman and Cutler to help people with past criminal records for cannabis possession seal their criminal records, and ChatGPT's ability to summarize and extract relevant information from documents. The author, Quinten Steenhuis, calls this new approach "grow bono" and encourages others to join or start similar efforts in their own states.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2922147" target="_blank">Higher Ed ‘Do Not Resuscitate’ Orders</a> by Matthew A. Bruckner. The article discusses how Congress has effectively precluded all institutions of higher education from reorganizing in the bankruptcy courts. It argues that Congress should reverse its decision and allow colleges to reorganize in bankruptcy, and it contrasts the bankruptcy treatment of healthcare enterprises to that of higher education enterprises.</p>

<p>It's February 14th, 2023.</p>

<p>Hey, it's Max here, bringing you the latest news. Today, we've got a story about Spotify's podcasting troubles, the upcoming Supreme Court cases of Gonzalez v. Google and Twitter v. Taamneh, and how online platforms have disrupted the news. So stay tuned, it's gonna be a wild ride! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.semafor.com</i>: <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/02/12/2023/how-spotifys-podcast-bet-went-wrong" target="_blank">How Spotify's podcast bet went wrong</a></br>Spotify's billion-dollar bet on podcasting has resulted in a podcast winter, as the company cuts back on spending and consolidates many of the small studios it helped support. The pivot is similar to recent cuts to Hollywood’s streaming television, as the streaming giant faces narrow profit margins and competition from tech giants Amazon and Apple. Spotify's strategy of making most major podcasts exclusive to the platform has been internally divisive, and the company has suffered from the costly acquisitions of celebrity talent who failed to create loyal audiences.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.brookings.edu</i>: <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/events/gonzalez-v-google-and-the-fate-of-section-230/" target="_blank">Gonzalez v. Google and the fate of Section 230</a></br>On February 14, a panel hosted by Governance Studies at Brookings will discuss the upcoming Supreme Court cases of Gonzalez v. Google and Twitter v. Taamneh, which concern the scope of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act and potential liability for websites for third-party content. The panel will discuss the implications of the cases for the regulation of social media and the legal responsibility of platforms for user content. Viewers can submit questions for the panelists via email or Twitter at #FateofSection230.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.cjr.org</i>: <a href="https://www.cjr.org/special_report/disrupting-journalism-how-platforms-have-upended-the-news-intro.php" target="_blank">Disrupting Journalism: How Platforms Have Upended the News </a></br>This article examines how online platforms have impacted the news media industry, leading to a crisis in journalism. It looks at how governments around the world have responded to the issue, as well as potential solutions to support sustainable journalism and curb misinformation. It also highlights the need for transnational dialogue and conflict between calls to support journalism and antitrust inquiries.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3159578" target="_blank">Terminating Tenure: Rejecting Tenure Contracts in Bankruptcy</a> by Matthew A. Bruckner. The article examines whether distressed institutions of higher education can use the bankruptcy system to restructure their contractual obligations with their tenured faculty. The answer to this inquiry depends on two key questions: 1) do professors have material obligations to their tenuring institution under a tenure contract, or are they more akin to one-sided option contracts; and 2) whether the bankruptcy court will apply the Countryman test or Westbrook's Functional analysis. The article also considers the argument that tenure is a protected property right under the Fifth Amendment Takings Clause, though it is largely dismissed.</p>

<p>It's February 13th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to the news roundup! In today's stories, we'll look at Starlink competitor Kymeta's attempts to position itself as a viable alternative to Elon Musk's satcom service. We'll also discuss the implications of the 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis case, which is testing whether businesses can lawfully turn away gay people. Finally, we'll explore how recent events on the internet can be seen in the light of the Tower of Babel story and how decentralized services may be the antidote to Babelization. So stay tuned as we take a closer look at each of these stories. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>news.bloomberglaw.com</i>: <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/federal-contracting/starlink-competitor-touts-pentagon-partnership-blasts-musk" target="_blank">Starlink Competitor Touts Pentagon Partnership, Blasts Musk</a></br>Starlink competitor Kymeta is positioning itself as a better satcom option for the Pentagon in light of the controversy surrounding Elon Musk's threats to cut off service in Ukraine. Kymeta, funded by Bill Gates, has donated and sold their technology to Ukraine and their chief development officer has condemned Musk's actions. Kymeta's technology provides more flexibility, redundancy, and security compared to Starlink and is expected to be the backbone of the Pentagon's Joint All-Domain Command and Control initiative. Kymeta is also in talks with other NATO countries and has several unclassified contracts with federal agencies.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.nybooks.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/online/2023/02/10/the-empty-words-of-the-religious-right/" target="_blank">The Empty Words of the Religious Right</a></br>ADF, a right-wing legal organization, is representing a web designer who wants to make wedding websites that promote her “religious belief that God designed marriage as an institution between one man and one woman.” This case, 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis, is testing whether businesses can lawfully turn away gay people. During oral arguments, Supreme Court justices made strange comments, suggesting a disregard of what is at stake in the case. ADF has been twisting the First Amendment's compelled speech doctrine, which originated during World War II as an essential safeguard of dissent and democracy, into a weapon against laws that protect minority rights. Trump-appointed judges in lower courts have already been persuaded. This case will show how far the Supreme Court is willing to go in this direction.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.wired.com</i>: <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/god-did-us-a-favor-by-destroying-twitter/" target="_blank">God Did the World a Favor by Destroying Twitter </a></br>An examination of the Tower of Babel story in light of recent events on the internet shows how humans often attempt to centralize and unify in ways that are ultimately unsustainable. Twitter's recent troubles are a prime example of this, as it has become a graveyard for many people's digital lives. However, the decentralized services of the Fediverse, such as Mastodon, provide an alternative way of connecting with others in small, stable groups. Monetizing these services remains a challenge, but with the right approach, these services may yet prove to be an antidote to Babelization.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4304442" target="_blank">Myths and Reality of Patent Law at the Supreme Court</a> by Paul R. Gugliuzza and Mark A. Lemley. The paper examines the conventional wisdoms about the Supreme Court's involvement in patent law and the trust the court places in the Federal Circuit and Solicitor General. The authors use quantitative and qualitative analysis of all patent cases since 1982 to assess the Supreme Court's impact on the patent system, and conclude that the court has been surprisingly deferential to the Federal Circuit.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's February 12th, 2023.</p>

<p>Today we have three stories in the news. First, open source seeds are loosening the grip of big ag companies on farmers, providing a welcomed alternative. Second, a controlled experiment shows how ideology can influence medical decisions, even amid a pandemic. Lastly, families are rallying around a Black author after his visit to an Alabama school district was canceled due to his alleged “controversial” social media posts. Stay tuned for more on these stories! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>worldsensorium.com</i>: <a href="https://worldsensorium.com/open-source-seeds-loosen-big-ags-grip-on-farmers/" target="_blank">“Open Source” Seeds Loosen Big Ag’s Grip on Farmers </a></br>Open source seeds are providing a new alternative to the multinational companies that have monopolized the global seed trade. The Open Source Seed Initiative, founded in 2012 by a group of agriculture experts, is aiming to create a free flow of genetic resources among plant breeders and farmers, while protecting the work of the breeders. The initiative is gaining traction in the US, Europe, Argentina, India, and other countries, and is helping to protect biodiversity, improve food security, and empower small farmers.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>arstechnica.com</i>: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/02/controlled-experiments-show-mds-dismissing-evidence-due-to-ideology/" target="_blank">Controlled experiments show MDs dismissing evidence due to ideology </a></br>This study shows how ideology can heavily influence medical decisions, even when it comes to evaluating treatments for a pandemic like COVID-19. A study involving 600 critical care physicians and 900 non-medical participants found that moderate to liberal physicians had similar opinions on the effectiveness of certain treatments like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin, but conservative physicians had opinions similar to those of the general public. These results suggest that ideology may be a major factor in determining treatment decisions.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.washingtonpost.com</i>: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/02/10/alabama-author-barnes-hoover-school/" target="_blank">Families rally around Black author amid canceled Alabama school events </a></br>An Alabama school district has canceled a visit by acclaimed children's author Derrick Barnes, who had been due to visit in early February for Black History Month. After the school district initially cited contractual issues as the reason, Superintendent Dee Fowler told AL.com that a parent had complained about "controversial ideas" on Barnes's social media accounts. In response, two families have launched fundraisers to support a charity Barnes had recommended and to fund a book drive to distribute Barnes's books across the city. The school district has not described or personally reviewed the content of the alleged "controversial" social media posts that the parent complained about.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2738580" target="_blank">Bankrupting Higher Education</a> by Matthew A. Bruckner. This article focuses on how institutions of higher education can benefit from the use of bankruptcy reorganization tools, which are available only in bankruptcy reorganizations. This article argues that for-profit colleges are most likely to benefit from access to bankruptcy reorganization, public colleges would likely benefit least from having bankruptcy reorganization available, and the myriad far-reaching benefits of granting all institutions of higher education the right to reorganize under the bankruptcy law far outweighs any potential risks.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's February 11th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's news update. Today's big stories include former US Vice President Mike Pence and former National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien subpoenaed by a special counsel, the New York Public Library's research showing up to 75% of books published before 1964 have entered the public domain, and the Esquiring Minds podcast talks Reedy Creek, DoNotPay and the AI Chatsplosion. Tune in for more details! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.theguardian.com</i>: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/09/mike-pence-subpoenaed-trump-special-counsel-investigations" target="_blank">Mike Pence subpoenaed in Trump special counsel investigations </a></br>Former US vice-president Mike Pence and the former national security adviser Robert O’Brien have been subpoenaed by the special counsel leading investigations into classified documents found at former president Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence and efforts to overturn the 2020 election result. Pence was issued a subpoena by special counsel Jack Smith, though the nature of the request was not immediately known, while O’Brien is asserting executive privilege in declining to provide some of the information that prosecutors are seeking from him. Trump’s former acting Department of Homeland Security secretary, Chad Wolf, was also interviewed by justice department lawyers in recent weeks as part of the ongoing investigation.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.vice.com</i>: <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/epzyde/librarians-are-finding-thousands-of-books-no-longer-protected-by-copyright-law" target="_blank">Librarians Are Finding Thousands Of Books No Longer Protected By Copyright Law</a></br>The New York Public Library (NYPL) has conducted research which has uncovered that up to 75 percent of books published before 1964 have entered the public domain. The public domain refers to creative works not protected by intellectual property law, such as copyright, and those works may not be protected for a variety of reasons. NYPL has partnered with the technology firm Data Conversion Laboratory (DCL) to manage their data and better understand the copyright status of the works. The U.S. Copyright Office has also committed to making all of its public records available and searchable online.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>zencastr.com</i>: <a href="https://zencastr.com/z/uv1cLQTi" target="_blank">Pearls Before Nothing: Reedy Creek, DoNotPay and AI Chatsplosion </a></br>Attorney Disney has a strong case if it goes to court over Reedy Creek, a Google AI chatbot made a mistake in a demo, and MSG Entertainment is lifting a ban for lawyers involved in lawsuits against them. Elon Musk has fired a top Twitter engineer as well. This news comes as the Esquiring Minds podcast is the 121st most popular technology podcast in Australia on Apple Podcasts.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3713136" target="_blank">The Forgotten Stewards of Higher Education Quality</a> by Matthew A. Bruckner. The article examines the "triad" of regulators responsible for ensuring student loan borrowers are not harmed by exploitative institutions of higher education, and suggests that the triad has failed in this regard.

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's February 10th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to the news of the day! Today, we'll look at the firing of a top Twitter engineer at the behest of Elon Musk, why a federal judge is questioning the constitutionality of abortion, and a Dungeon Master's Helper. Get ready to explore the world of tech news, legal issues, and gaming! Plus, a new online server, nginx, has launched to provide a permanent home for the website. So buckle up, it's time to dive into the stories of today! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.platformer.news</i>: <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/elon-musk-fires-a-top-twitter-engineer" target="_blank">Elon Musk fires a top Twitter engineer over his declining view count</a></br>Elon Musk fired a top Twitter engineer at a meeting at the Twitter headquarters in San Francisco on Tuesday. The reason for the firing was reportedly due to the engineer presenting data that showed a decline in engagement with Musk's tweets. Internal data and a Google Trends chart showed that Musk's popularity in search rankings had decreased from a score of 100 in April to a score of 9. Musk has instructed employees to track how many times each of his tweets are recommended and has expressed dissatisfaction with engineers' work so far. At the same time, Twitter usage in the United States has declined almost 9 percent since Musk's takeover, and employees have described the current workplace as chaotic and disorganized.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>slate.com</i>: <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/02/federal-judge-abortion-still-constitutional-dobbs-13th-amenedment.html?fbclid=IwAR0ZXo50NFjoegC2Ts-uSG96TYDzon7IB-5RwO47Qbxwr4K_zeTDJIWXS3I" target="_blank">Why a federal judge is asking if abortion is still maybe constitutional.</a></br>A U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly has asked for a supplemental briefing to determine whether the right to abortion is secretly protected by the 13th Amendment's ban on “involuntary servitude”. This comes in response to a criminal case against anti-abortion activists accused of conspiring to block access to a D.C. abortion clinic. The judge's order follows the Supreme Court's reversal of Roe v. Wade in June, which has led to an alternate-reality timeline of reproductive health care in the U.S. and a choose-your-own-ending field of modern abortion regulation.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>colarusso.github.io</i>: <a href="https://colarusso.github.io/dm/" target="_blank">Dungeon Master's Helper</a></br>A new tool has been created to help people learn the popular role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons. The tool was created by David Colarusso and is available on GitHub if people want to make their own edits.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4228573" target="_blank">Accidental Abolition? Exploring Section 230 as Non-Reformist Reform</a> by Kendra Albert. The paper explores the possibilities of Section 230, which may be the largest single carveout of people and entities from state criminal liability in United States history, and how platforms have failed to build meaningful non-carceral solutions in the absence of criminal liability. The paper applies the questions of Critical Resistance, an abolitionist organization, to explore whether Section 230 is an example of a non-reformist reform.</p>

<p>It's February 9th, 2023.</p>

<p>I'm bringing you the latest news from around the world. Developers have created AI to generate police sketches, and experts are horrified. Americans are still in the dark about what companies can do with their personal data, and that's a problem. And President Biden is outlining his vision to advance progress on his Unity Agenda in the year ahead. All this and more! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.vice.com</i>: <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjk745/ai-police-sketches" target="_blank">Developers Created AI to Generate Police Sketches. Experts Are Horrified</a></br>Police sketch AI-rtist, created by developers Artur Fortunato and Filipe Reynaud is raising concerns about the potential for AI to worsen existing racial and gender biases present in initial witness descriptions. AI experts and researchers warn that this technology can be dangerous, as it may lead to false or misleading forensics, leading to wrongful convictions. This technology, combined with the already unreliable process of witness descriptions, could place suspicion on already over-criminalized populations.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.asc.upenn.edu</i>: <a href="https://www.asc.upenn.edu/news-events/news/americans-dont-understand-what-companies-can-do-their-personal-data-and-thats-problem" target="_blank">Americans Don’t Understand What Companies Can Do With Their Personal Data — and That’s a Problem</a></br>This new survey of 2,000 Americans has revealed that most do not understand the data collection and marketing policies of online companies and feel powerless to stop them. It showed that the majority do not even understand the term "privacy policy" and fear the potential harm their data can cause. Additionally, the survey revealed that the majority of Americans would have received an "F" if they had taken a quiz on internet marketing practices and policies. The researchers suggest that Congress should act now to regulate how companies can use personal information, and the onus should be shifted from individuals to companies.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.whitehouse.gov</i>: <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/02/07/fact-sheet-in-state-of-the-union-president-biden-to-outline-vision-to-advance-progress-on-unity-agenda-in-year-ahead/" target="_blank">FACT SHEET - In State of the Union, President Biden to Outline Vision to Advance Progress on Unity Agenda in Year Ahead</a></br>President Biden announced a four-part Unity Agenda during his first State of the Union address, focusing on ending cancer as we know it, delivering on the sacred obligation to veterans, tackling the mental health crisis, and beating the opioid and overdose epidemic. The President called on Congress to act to end cancer as we know it and urged them to reauthorize the National Cancer Act and lock in the strong investment in cancer research passed in 2016. He also announced plans to provide patient navigation support to every American facing cancer and take steps to help people avoid smoking. Additionally, he called for investment in ARPA-H to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and other diseases. Finally, he plans to reduce veteran suicide and deliver more benefits and health care more quickly to more veterans than ever before.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4286147" target="_blank">Using Terms and Conditions to Apply Fundamental Rights to Content Moderation</a> by João Pedro Quintais, Naomi Appelman, and Ronan Fahy. This paper examines how the Digital Services Act (DSA) of the European Union will affect the enforcement of terms and conditions (T&Cs) on online platforms. Article 14 of the DSA requires platforms to have "due regard" to the fundamental rights of users under the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. The authors argue that this provision can establish the indirect horizontal effect of fundamental rights in the relationship between platforms and their users.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's February 8th, 2023.</p>

<p>Today, we'll be exploring the history of DoNotPay, the Mastodon bump that's become a slump, and a Design Patent Examiner job opening. Techdirt has the scoop on DoNotPay, and why it's claims may not be as valid as they appear. We'll also take a look at the Mastodon open source platform and the obstacles it faces when it comes to user growth. Plus, if you're in the market for a job, we have the perfect opportunity for you! The U.S. Patent and Trademark office is looking for Design Patent Examiners, so tune in to find out more! It's all coming up, next! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.techdirt.com</i>: <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/02/07/heres-the-article-we-didnt-run-back-in-2017-about-donotpay/" target="_blank">Here’s The Article We Didn’t Run Back In 2017 About DoNotPay</a></br>This article explores the history of DoNotPay, a startup created by Josh Browder as a teenager, and the questionable claims he has made since its launch. In the past, Browder has resisted providing data to validate his claims, but recent research by Kathryn Tewson has revealed some discrepancies. The article also discusses a draft article about DoNotPay that was written five years ago, but was never published.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.wired.com</i>: <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-mastodon-bump-is-now-a-slump/" target="_blank">The Mastodon Bump Is Now a Slump</a></br>Active users of the open source microblogging platform Mastodon have fallen by more than 1 million since the surge in sign-ups following the takeover of Elon Musk's Twitter last October. Despite its promise as an independent alternative to mainstream social media, many newcomers have complained that Mastodon is difficult to use. The platform's admins have worked hard to get servers back online and added content moderation policies to handle the influx of new users. The platform is now back to being manageable, though the legal burden on Mastodon server admins may soon increase if Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act is weakened or eliminated.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.usajobs.gov</i>: <a href="https://www.usajobs.gov/job/686135400" target="_blank">Design Patent Examiner </a></br>This job announcement from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is open to U.S. citizens and nationals. The position is a Design Patent Examiner, with a salary range of $61,325 to $79,722 per year. The physical worksite for this position is in Alexandria, Virginia, however the duties may be performed throughout the United States and Puerto Rico. The duties involve evaluating patent applications and determining whether patents can be granted for inventions. New patent examiners receive top-notch training upon hiring, and the position requires a background investigation and fingerprint check. Applicants must meet the United States Office of Personnel Management's qualification requirements for the advertised position.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4349023" target="_blank">Familial Searches, The Fourth Amendment, and Genomic Control</a> by Jacob S. Sherkow, Natalie Ram and Carl Gunter. This essay examines how police are increasingly using consumer genomic databases to solve crimes, such as long-cold serial killings and assaults, without judicial oversight and the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement. It then outlines a novel technology that would allow users to engage in genomic analysis securely, while ensuring that Fourth Amendment protections are upheld.</p>

<p>It's February 7th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to the news of today. In Washington, D.C. a federal judge is considering if the Constitution guarantees a right to abortion, separate from the Supreme Court's ruling on Roe v. Wade. Meanwhile, in Vallejo, California, senior officials have been accused of ordering the destruction of evidence from police shootings. And finally, a letter in the New Yorker challenges the idea that 3-D printing can solve the U.S. homelessness crisis. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.politico.com</i>: <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/02/06/federal-judge-constitutional-right-abortion-dobbs-00081391" target="_blank">Federal judge says constitutional right to abortion may still exist, despite Dobbs</a></br>A federal judge in Washington, D.C. has suggested that there may be a constitutional right to abortion baked into the 13th Amendment, which would be a separate right from that of the 14th Amendment addressed by the Supreme Court in its decision to overturn Roe v. Wade last year. The judge has asked the parties in a criminal case involving charges of blocking access to abortion clinics to present arguments on the issue. The question remains if any other provision of the Constitution could confer a right to abortion, which could potentially be the final pronouncement on the issue.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>openvallejo.org</i>: <a href="https://openvallejo.org/2023/02/05/vallejo-destroyed-evidence-of-police-killings/" target="_blank">Senior officials ordered destruction of Vallejo police shooting evidence</a></br>The city of Vallejo destroyed multiple pieces of evidence from police shootings and one non-fatal shooting in January 2021, against city policy and potentially in violation of the city's agreement with the California Department of Justice. Documents requested by Open Vallejo appear to show Assistant City Attorney Katelyn Knight authorizing the destruction of evidence, although the City Attorney later claimed the purge had not been officially approved. Open Vallejo has asked the judge overseeing the lawsuit to consider referring the matter for criminal prosecution.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.newyorker.com</i>: <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/02/13/letters-from-the-february-13-and-20-2023-issue" target="_blank">Fit to Print?</a></br>A letter in the New Yorker  suggests that 3-D printing is unlikely to solve the U.S. homelessness crisis, as the problem is primarily rooted in legal infrastructure, not physical infrastructure. Meanwhile, architects suggest that the material of choice for 3-D printing, concrete, has several drawbacks, including low R-value and increased susceptibility to seismic failure.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4327890" target="_blank">User-Generated Content Shapes Judicial Reasoning: Evidence From a Randomized Control Trial on Wikipedia</a> which was written by Neil Thompson, Xueyun Luo, Brian McKenzie, Edana Richardson and Brian Flanagan. This paper discusses how user-generated content, such as Wikipedia articles, are used to influence legal judgments and how this could have an effect on the judicial system. Through a randomized control trial, the paper shows that the presence of a Wikipedia article about Irish Supreme Court decisions makes it more likely that the corresponding case will be cited as a precedent by judges in subsequent decisions. Additionally, the language used in the Wikipedia article also influences the language used in judgments. The paper encourages greater attention to be paid to ensuring that user-generated content contains the highest quality of information.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's February 6th, 2023.</p>

<p>Max here, bringing you the latest news from around the world. Big news today: the US economy has seen some huge gains, with a 3.4% unemployment rate and 517,000 new jobs in January. President Biden is celebrating, and it looks like his economic plans are paying off. On the music front, we're looking at why modern pop songs often have so many credited writers, and why that can be a contentious issue. And finally, everyone's favorite social media app, Mastodon, has a new app to help keep you up to date with the latest events. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>news.feedseer.com</i>: <a href="https://news.feedseer.com/welcome" target="_blank">FeedSeer News for Mastodon</a></br>Stay up to date with the latest events being discussed by your friends with FeedSeer News! This app allows you to see the most popular links that have appeared in your Mastodon feed over the past day, along with preview text and pictures. All you need to do is authorize the app to have read access to your feed and you're good to go!</p>

<p>Next, from <i>tedium.co</i>: <a href="https://tedium.co/2023/02/04/why-do-modern-pop-songs-have-so-many-credited-writers/" target="_blank">Why Do Modern Pop Songs Have So Many Credited Writers?</a></br>This article examines the recent trend of modern songwriting, which often involves aggressive credit-grabbing, even when the person did not contribute to the song's composition. The article looks at a tweet from Diane Warren, who asked why Beyonce's song "Alien Superstar" had 24 songwriters listed. The article explains that samples and interpolations of other pieces require songwriter credits, but even when those are removed, there is still a substantial increase in the amount of songwriters listed. The article further examines the reasons for this trend, including money, the computer, and the changing definition of songwriting.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.politico.com</i>: <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/02/03/biden-on-jobs-numbers-the-critics-and-cynics-are-wrong-00081084" target="_blank">Biden on robust jobs numbers: The ‘critics and cynics are wrong’ </a></br>President Joe Biden celebrated the latest jobs report showing a 3.4 percent unemployment rate, the lowest since May 1969, saying that the "Biden economic plan is working." The economy created 517,000 jobs in January, which Biden described as a "blowout" jobs report. The report also arms the White House with a line of defense against Republican attacks over Biden's spending policies. Inflation remains an issue, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell is working to get inflation down to the central bank's target range of 2 percent.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3340960" target="_blank">Infringement, Unbound</a> by Sarah R. Wasserman Rajec. This paper argues that patent infringement doctrines which allow for expanded liability beyond the normal bounds of patent enforcement should be seen as a complement to the boundaries governing patent scope instead of a risk to the delicate balance of patent law. This article examines the requirements set forth by the patent in terms of subject matter, term, and scope and how recent enforcement rules have loosened them, such as by holding manufacturers and retailers liable for the infringement of their customers as “indirect” infringers. It argues for reform of patent infringement doctrines and that any changes must be moored to the same fundamental purposes that motivate the delicate balance patent law seeks.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's February 5th, 2023.</p>

<p>Good evening everyone! It's Max here with all the news that's fit to be streamed. Today, we take a look at the media's treatment of Sam Bankman-Fried, the thirty-year-old accused of running a cryptocurrency trading platform. We'll also cover the EU and US coming together to cooperate on Artificial Intelligence research and how conservative politicians are trying to censor ideological discussion in the classroom. So stay tuned for the latest news on the world of tech and politics! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>newsletter.mollywhite.net</i>: <a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/p/sam-bankman-fried-is-not-a-child" target="_blank">Sam Bankman-Fried is not a child </a></br>This article discusses the media's treatment of thirty-year-old Sam Bankman-Fried. Despite his age, he has been described by the media and public as a "boy genius," a "wunderkind," and a "whiz kid." He is currently on house arrest after the collapse of his cryptocurrency trading platform, FTX. The article argues that SBF is being given the benefit of the doubt that other accused criminals are not, due to his image, privilege, and the perception that he is still a child. It suggests that while young Black children are often adultified, Bankman-Fried is being infantilized by the media, and this could influence the public's perception of his culpability.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.euractiv.com</i>: <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/artificial-intelligence/news/eu-us-step-up-ai-cooperation-amid-policy-crunchtime/" target="_blank">EU, US step up AI cooperation amid policy crunchtime</a></br>European and US leaders have signed an agreement to cooperate on Artificial Intelligence research. The agreement was signed in the context of the EU-US Trade and Technology Council and is part of an effort to reach a common approach on trustworthiness and risk management for AI technology. Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton stated that researchers from both sides will join forces to develop socially beneficial applications of AI.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.theguardian.com</i>: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/04/conservatives-ron-desantis-florida-education?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other" target="_blank">Conservatives angry about school ‘indoctrination’ are telling on themselves</a></br>This article discusses the attempts by Florida's Republican Governor Ron DeSantis to suppress critical race theory in the state's educational curriculum, as well as his and other conservative politicians' attempts to promote a patriotic vision of America and censor ideological discussion in the classroom. It argues that this crusade undermines the purpose of education which is to enable citizens to be fearless and critical, and that it is authoritarian in nature. The article also suggests that educators are intimidated by these initiatives, and that the current climate is damaging US democracy.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4181948" target="_blank">Uncommon Carriage</a> by Blake E. Reid. This article challenges the coherence of “common carriage” as a field and its utility for assessing the constitutionality and policy wisdom of Internet regulation. It assesses the post-Civil War history of common carriage regimes in telecommunications law, and disentangles talismanic invocations of “common carriage” by isolating three distinct questions. The article argues for a context-sensitive approach to Internet regulations that evaluates the designation of carriers, the imposition of rules, and the role of the First Amendment on a granular basis that more seriously accounts for the complexity of contemporary Internet platforms.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's February 4th, 2023.</p>

<p>Hey, everyone! It's Max here with a roundup of the hottest stories of the day. First up, talc and Twitter have been in the news, with a court ruling on talc products and Twitter ending free access to its API. Next, Harvard's Technology and Social Change Project is shutting down in 2024 due to a policy change. Finally, WIPIP is discussing the legal implications of midcentury modern design and how to separate utility patents and design patents. Don't miss out on the latest developments on these stories – stay tuned! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>zencastr.com</i>: <a href="https://zencastr.com/z/OPHESHOp" target="_blank">Space Karen and the Scummy Texas Two-Step </a></br>In this episode of Esquiring Minds, a recent court ruling has thrown out a bankruptcy case filed by Johnson & Johnson regarding its talc products. This comes on the heels of news that Twitter will be ending free access to its API and a legal AI bot company which has been mocked, prompting a ban on people testing its services.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.washingtonpost.com</i>: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/02/02/misinformation-harvard-donovan-close/" target="_blank">Joan Donovan's misinformaton project at Harvard will close in 2024 - The Washington Post</a></br>Harvard University has announced the closure of the Kennedy School of Government's Technology and Social Change Project, which has studied online misinformation since 2019, due to a school policy requiring faculty members to lead such an undertaking. The project's director, Joan Donovan, a widely cited expert on digital "media manipulation," is not a faculty member and could not continue. This closure comes as the field of study into misinformation and access to data is undergoing changes, with Twitter announcing it will begin charging for automated access and other platforms such as TikTok, Discord, and Twitch presenting new challenges for data gathering.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>tushnet.blogspot.com</i>: <a href="http://tushnet.blogspot.com/2023/02/wipip-concurrent-session-1-design.html" target="_blank">Rebecca Tushnet's 43(B)log: WIPIP, Concurrent Session #1, Design</a></br>This WIPIP concurrent session discussed the issues surrounding midcentury modern design, including the legal implications of replicating designs, the debate surrounding the idea of authenticity and its role in product design, and how the term "iconic" is used in brands and in wider culture. It also addressed the differences between utility patents and design patents and how separating them could help to resolve inconsistencies.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4342652" target="_blank">Legislative Constitutionalism & Federal Indian Law</a> by Maggie Blackhawk. This article explores the diminishing role of the U.S. Supreme Court in constitutional law making and its growing dominance over constitutional interpretation. The article suggests that federal Indian law may offer a unique perspective on how the other branches of government can play a more significant role in making and interpreting constitutional law.</p>

<p>It's February 3rd, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to the latest news roundup! Twitter's internal shake-up has led to concerns over the security of direct messages, and people should be aware of their rights when requesting erasure. Meanwhile, the case of Tyre Nichols has sparked a narrative from the right that may not be accurate. And finally, the Justice Department and a technology industry group have both thrown their support behind the proposal for a design patent bar. Stay tuned. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>michae.lv</i>: <a href="https://michae.lv/deleting-dms-from-twitter/" target="_blank">Deleting DMs from Twitter using the GDPR</a></br>Twitter's Chief Information Security Officer, Chief Privacy Officer, Chief Compliance Officer and head of Trust and Safety have all resigned this week, leaving engineers to self-certify compliance with FTC requirements and other laws. This has sparked concerns around the security of direct messages, which are not end-to-end encrypted, leading to questions around data safety and the right to erasure. People can make an erasure request to Twitter via a confidential reporting form, and should set a calendar reminder for 1 month’s time to follow up if they have not received a response.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>radleybalko.substack.com</i>: <a href="https://radleybalko.substack.com/p/tyre-nichols-wasnt-murdered-because" target="_blank">Tyre Nichols wasn't murdered because of "affirmative action" </a></br>In response to the death of Tyre Nichols in Memphis, a narrative has been circulating on the right claiming that the officers involved with his death were only hired due to lax hiring standards related to race. However, an investigation into their hiring records has revealed that two of the officers may have met the pre-existing standards and the other three were hired before the more relaxed standards were implemented. Furthermore, the new police budget in Memphis has increased funding and given officers raises, making the defunding the police narrative moot.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.law360.com</i>: <a href="https://www.law360.com/ip/articles/1565768?nl_pk=fd062d42-234e-4b6a-b9b5-4052fd7ef7ac&" target="_blank">Design Patent Bar At USPTO Draws Many Supporters - Law360</a></br>Design Patent Bar At USPTO Draws Many Supporters: The Justice Department's Antitrust Division, a technology industry group and others have thrown their support behind a proposal to create a separate design patent bar at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, while two key intellectual property groups have pushed back on the idea. The proposal was backed by the American Bar Association and the American Intellectual Property Law Association and opposed by the Intellectual Property Owners Association.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4315919" target="_blank">Effects of Illinois' 36% Interest Rate Cap on Small-Dollar Credit Availability and Financial Well-being</a> written by J. Brandon Bolen, Gregory Elliehausen and Thomas Miller. The paper focuses on the effects of a binding interest-rate cap imposed on loans under $40,000 from non-bank and non-credit-union lenders. Using credit bureau data from Illinois and a neighboring state without an interest-rate cap, the authors find that the cap decreased the number of loans to subprime borrowers by 44 percent and increased the average loan size to subprime borrowers by 40 percent. An online survey of Illinois' short-term, small-dollar-credit borrowers revealed that most were unable to borrow money when needed following the imposition of the interest-rate cap and only 11 percent reported that their financial well-being improved following the interest-rate cap. The paper concludes that due to the interest-rate cap, the availability of small-dollar credit decreased significantly, particularly to subprime borrowers, and worsened the financial well-being of many consumers.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's February 2nd, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's news. We've got a lot of stories for you so let’s jump right into it. First off, the Justice Department is looking into Tesla's self-driving technology following reports of 35 crashes and 14 deaths. Then, we'll take a look at the battle over free speech in Florida, where three laws are leading to changes in schools. Finally, the CFPB is proposing a rule to rein in excessive credit card late fees. All that and more, so stay tuned! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/31/technology/tesla-autopilot-investigation.html" target="_blank">Tesla’s Self-Driving Technology Comes Under Justice Dept. Scrutiny</a></br>The Justice Department is investigating Tesla's self-driving technology. The requests for documents relate to Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features, which allow cars to operate autonomously but require oversight by a human driver. Tesla has received 35 crash reports involving Autopilot, 9 of which resulted in 14 deaths. Tesla has said no wrongdoing has been determined and that any enforcement action could have a significant impact on finances.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.lawdork.com</i>: <a href="https://www.lawdork.com/p/floridas-war-on-school-speech-a-law" target="_blank">Florida's war on school speech, a Law Dork Q&A</a></br>Florida has been in the news recently due to Governor Ron DeSantis and the Republican project to restrict certain types of discussions in schools, such as race, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Three laws, the Stop WOKE Act, the “Don’t Say Gay” law, and H.B. 1467, are leading to a lot of changes in the state, such as empty library shelves and canceled courses. Jerry Edwards, a staff attorney with the ACLU of Florida, is part of the team challenging part of the Stop WOKE Act in court and spoke to Law Dork about the Stop WOKE Act litigation and other free speech questions being raised in the state. Edwards said that while the job security is guaranteed, he would rather not have it because the governments of the United States and Florida are violating people's rights. The case is currently set for trial in 2023 and the state is appealing the injunction against the Stop WOKE Act, which would allow the state to enforce the law if the appeal is successful.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.consumerfinance.gov</i>: <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-proposes-rule-to-rein-in-excessive-credit-card-late-fees/" target="_blank">CFPB Proposes Rule to Rein in Excessive Credit Card Late Fees</a></br>Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau proposed a rule to close a loophole exploited by credit card companies to hike fees with inflation. The proposed rule could save families billions of dollars and help ensure that over the top late fees are illegal. The proposed rule would lower the immunity provision for late fees to $8 for a missed payment, end the automatic annual inflation adjustment, and cap late fees at 25% of the consumer’s required payment. Comments must be received on or before April 3, 2023, or within 30 days after publication of the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the Federal Register, whichever is later.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2801672" target="_blank">Conflicts & Capital Allocation</a> written by Benjamin Edwards. The paper argues that the current regulatory structure for financial advice incentivizes financial advisors to manipulate and deceive retail investors, negatively affecting capital allocation throughout the economy. To address this issue, the paper suggests that an effective policy response should focus on compensation incentives and limit conflicts of interest.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's February 1st, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to the news roundup! First, we're discussing redistricting litigation across the U.S., and how it could impact the control of Congress in 2024. Then, we're saying farewell to the iconic Boeing 747, which has been around for over five decades. Finally, we're noting the University of Texas School of Law's call for papers for their eighth annual Administrative Law New Scholarship Roundtable. Stay tuned to get the details on all of these stories! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.democracydocket.com</i>: <a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/opinion/redistricting-lawsuits-could-impact-control-of-congress/" target="_blank">Redistricting Lawsuits Could Impact Control of Congress</a></br>Redistricting litigation across the U.S. could significantly impact the control of Congress in the 2024 election. According to a new report from Democracy Docket, more than half of the states with multiple congressional seats have already been involved in redistricting litigation, and 70% of those cases are ongoing. Six of the ten most populous states still have litigation over their congressional maps, with potential for a double-digit seat swing either way. Racial discrimination remains the major theme of these lawsuits, with more than half of the redistricting cases containing claims of racial discrimination or violation of the Voting Rights Act. The outcome of these cases could be decisive in determining the speaker's gavel in 2025.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.cbsnews.com</i>: <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/boeing-747-queen-of-the-skies-flying-off-history/" target="_blank">Boeing 747, the "Queen of the Skies," flying off into history</a></br>Boeing's iconic 747 airplane, the "Queen of the Skies," is flying off into history after more than five decades of transporting passengers, astronauts, and cargo around the world. CBS News was there as Vic Anderson, the lead mechanic on the last 747, took his dad, Andy, who was a supervisor on the prototype, to see the final assembly of the plane. After building 1,574 747s, Boeing will deliver the very last one on Tuesday to Atlas Air. Vic Anderson said he never thought he would outlast the famous plane.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.yalejreg.com</i>: <a href="https://www.yalejreg.com/nc/call-for-papers-eighth-annual-administrative-law-new-scholarship-roundtable/" target="_blank">Call for Papers: Eighth Annual Administrative Law New Scholarship Roundtable - Yale Journal on Regulation</a></br>The University of Texas School of Law is pleased to host the eighth annual Administrative Law New Scholarship Roundtable on May 16-17, 2023. Scholars wishing to present a paper and participate in the Roundtable should submit a one-to-two-page abstract by Wednesday, February 1. The Roundtable is an opportunity for approximately twelve authors to workshop their papers in a series of individual sessions, one for each paper, over the course of a day and a half. The University of Texas School of Law will provide meals and lodging for two nights at the University’s AT&T Conference Center. Scholars must have less than ten years of tenure-track teaching to be eligible to submit.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3906001" target="_blank">Disorderly Content</a> written by Ari Ezra Waldman. This paper is a contribution to the sociolegal literature as it approaches content moderation from an explicitly queer perspective. It argues that platforms are recreating for the digital age structures of control that have long been used to police public expression of queer sexuality. The paper details and challenges the current content moderation literature and explores potential new directions for scholarship, moderation, and law.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's January 31st, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's news roundup! We have a statement from US law professors about proposed legal reforms in Israel, an incident involving a Molotov cocktail being thrown at a synagogue in New Jersey, and a booklist of 10 books to add to your collection and share with readers in honor of Black History Month.  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>uslawprofstatementisrael.com</i>: <a href="https://uslawprofstatementisrael.com/" target="_blank">US Law Professors' Statement About the Proposed Law Reforms in Israel</a></br>This article discusses the opposition from a large group of law professors in the United States to the effort by the current Israeli government to drastically overhaul the country's legal system. The proposed reforms would grant the ruling coalition absolute power to appoint justices and judges and severely limit judicial review of executive-branch decisions and curtail the independence of the Attorney General and legal advisers. The signatories of the article express their worry that the reforms would weaken the independence of the judiciary, the separation of powers, and the rule of law, which have been instrumental in helping Israel flourish over the past 75 years.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/29/nyregion/arson-temple-ner-tamid-new-jersey.html" target="_blank">Molotov Cocktail Hurled at a New Jersey Synagogue, Police Say</a></br>A man wearing a ski mask lit a Molotov cocktail and threw it at the front door of a synagogue in Bloomfield, New Jersey early on Sunday morning. Fortunately, the synagogue, Temple Ner Tamid, was undamaged, and the fire went out on impact. In addition, an incident at an Episcopal church in Asbury Park, NJ is also under investigation for possible bias. The Bloomfield Police Department is offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to an arrest, and the synagogue is expecting an increased police presence in the coming days. The Anti-Defamation League of New York and New Jersey has reported a spike in antisemitic incidents and threats against synagogues in New Jersey.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.libraryjournal.com</i>: <a href="https://www.libraryjournal.com/story/Black-History-Month-10-Books-To-Add-to-the-Collection-and-Share-with-Readers-2022" target="_blank">Black History Month: 10 Books To Add to the Collection and Share with Readers</a></br>This Black History Month booklist features a range of essential works of fiction and nonfiction that celebrate African American culture and experiences. The books on this list, written by both debut and experienced authors, cover a wide variety of topics, such as poetry, trauma, enslavement, freedom, civil rights, ongoing obstacles for Black people, triumphs, justice, and workplace successes. Readers can access a downloadable list of these titles and a copy of the page for posting and sharing. Additionally, readers can get print or digital editions of the list with a subscription.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3810924" target="_blank">Beyond Republicans and the Disapproval of Regulations: A New Empirical Approach to the Congressional Review Act</a> by Steven J. Balla, Bridget C.E. Dooling, and Daniel R. Pérez. The paper focuses on the use of Congressional Review Act as an instrument of position taking for legislators of both political parties. It analyses an original data set of all resolutions disapproving of agency regulations introduced over a twenty-six-year period to demonstrate that Democrats make regular use of the CRA and that resolutions are consistently pursued outside of presidential transitions.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's January 30th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's top stories! In Minnesota, a new law has been passed that guarantees the right to abortions. We'll take a look at how this law came to be and what it means for the state. And in other news, we'll discover why people believe in conspiracy theories – is it sheer stupidity, or something more insidious? Finally, we'll examine the case of John Eastman, former Dean at Chapman University's Dale E. Fowler School of Law, who's facing disciplinary charges for his role in Donald Trump's attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. All that and more, coming up next! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>religionclause.blogspot.com</i>: <a href="http://religionclause.blogspot.com/2023/01/minnesota-passes-law-guaranteeing-right.html" target="_blank">Religion Clause: Minnesota Passes Law Guaranteeing Right To Abortions</a></br>Minnesota legislature has passed a bill that guarantees the right to abortions. The bill, the Protect Reproductive Options Act, was proposed to provide a secondary line of defense for abortion rights already guaranteed in the 1995 Minnesota Supreme Court decision, Doe v. Gomez. The bill now goes to Minnesota Governor Tim Walz for his signature, who has said he will sign it into law.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.businessinsider.com</i>: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-people-believe-conspiracy-theory-overconfidence-2023-1" target="_blank">Why people believe in conspiracy theories: plain old overconfidence</a></br>Conspiracy theories have been spreading like wildfire on social media platforms, with the majority of Americans believing at least one tale. New research has revealed that the common factor among those who believe in these theories is overconfidence. People think they are right all the time and are less likely to evaluate evidence critically. This arrogance is proving to be harder to stamp out than stupidity, so it is important to have faith in yourself without becoming too confident.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>terikanefield.com</i>: <a href="https://terikanefield.com/john-eastmans-its-a-political-witch-hunt-defense/" target="_blank">John Eastman's "It's A Political Witch Hunt" Defense </a></br>John Eastman, a former Henry Salvatori Professor of Law & Community Service and former Dean at Chapman University’s Dale E. Fowler School of Law, is facing disciplinary charges from the California State Bar for his role in Donald Trump's attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. The charges come after a bipartisan group filed a complaint against Eastman with the California State Bar in October 2021. The charges relate to Eastman's alleged violations of the code of professional responsibility for lawyers. If found guilty, Eastman could face disbarment.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4324090&dgcid=ejournal_htmlemail_intellectual:property:copyright:law:ejournal_abstractlink" target="_blank">Tattoos, Norms, and Implied Licenses</a> by Aaron Perzanowski. The essay considers the legal questions raised by the recent surge of tattoo copyright litigation, and its intersection with tattoo industry norms. Perzanowski argues that public displays, reproductions, and derivative works of tattoo designs employed to accurately depict the body of a tattooed person, fall under the scope of an implied license created by the expected bargain between the tattooer and their client. He further suggests that copyright assertions are inconsistent with the core purpose of tattooing as a social practice, and could lead to disruption of the industry's expectations, costs, and legal risks.</p>

<p>It's January 29th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's news roundup! A report from TechCrunch on how US police are using digital data to prosecute women for abortions. We'll take a look at a New York Times piece on how a drug company made $114 billion by gaming the US patent system. And we'll discuss how white America is offloading its failures onto civil rights movements.  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>techcrunch.com</i>: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/27/digital-data-roe-wade-reproductive-privacy/" target="_blank">How US police use digital data to prosecute abortions </a></br>Police in several states have used digital data to prosecute women for abortions in recent years. In some cases, police have obtained warrants to search digital devices to uncover conversations and evidence of abortion pills purchased online. In other cases, family members, friends or medical staff have notified authorities of suspected abortions. Despite a US Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade last summer, efforts to combat police use of digital data for abortion prosecutions are underway.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/28/business/humira-abbvie-monopoly.html" target="_blank">How a Drug Company Made $114 Billion by Gaming the U.S. Patent System </a></br>AbbVie has been exploiting the US patent system to keep generic versions of its blockbuster drug, Humira, off the market, allowing it to charge high prices and generating $114 billion in revenue since 2016. Next week, the monopoly is expected to end and prices are likely to drop. Patients have had to pay thousands of dollars out-of-pocket for the medication while AbbVie has profited and other pharmaceutical companies have followed its lead.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>sherrilyn.substack.com</i>: <a href="https://sherrilyn.substack.com/p/a-response-to-conor-friedersdorf" target="_blank">When White America Offloads its Failures on to Civil Rights Movements</a></br>Sherrilyn Ifill has written a response to the recent Atlantic newsletter from Conor Friedersdorf in which he claimed that “the Black Lives Matter approach” to ending police violence against Black people “has largely failed.” Ifill argues that it is wrong to blame the civil rights movement for the failure of white people to effectively confront and contain the manifestations of violent white supremacy. She notes that Black Lives Matter was first a call to action, a statement of demand for respect for Black people's humanity, and has since become the rallying cry and social media hashtag for Black people protesting police brutality. She further details the progress that has been made in terms of reforms to policing, and the broader movement to end police violence, and argues that the failure of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act was not the fault of the Black Lives Matter movement, but rather the lack of support from Republican Senators. Finally, she argues that the current system cannot be reformed and must be made over, and that the recent police response in Uvalde and lack of support for Capitol Police officers assaulted on January 6th has been a huge blow to law enforcement.</p>

<p>It's January 28th, 2023.</p>

<p>Hey there, it's Max! Today, a leak of phone numbers has revealed the use of intrusive spyware in Europe, threatening human rights. A new model called MusicLM has been released to generate high-fidelity music from text descriptions. And we remember Lt. Jack ReVelle, the man who saved North Carolina from nuclear disaster by disarming two hydrogen bombs.  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.coe.int</i>: <a href="https://www.coe.int/en/web/commissioner/-/highly-intrusive-spyware-threatens-the-essence-of-human-rights" target="_blank">Highly intrusive spyware threatens the essence of human rights - Commissioner for Human Rights</a></br>Over 18 months have since a leak of over 50,000 phone numbers, including those of many human rights defenders, journalists, academics, and opposition leaders, was exposed by an international coalition of investigative journalists. This leak revealed that the highly intrusive Pegasus spyware had been used to target these individuals, which has a chilling effect on other human rights and fundamental freedoms, such as freedom of expression and public participation. In order for Council of Europe member states to prevent grave human rights violations stemming from the use of such spyware, they must comply with their obligations under the European Convention and ensure that its use is lawful, legitimate, necessary, and proportionate.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>google-research.github.io</i>: <a href="https://google-research.github.io/seanet/musiclm/examples/" target="_blank">MusicLM: Generating Music From Text</a></br>This article introduces MusicLM, a model that generates high-fidelity music from text descriptions. Experiments show that it outperforms existing systems in audio quality and consistency. MusicCaps, a dataset of 5.5k text-music pairs provided by human experts, has also been released to support future research. MusicLM can additionally be conditioned on text and melody and is capable of generating audio from both painting descriptions and text prompts. It also has the ability to generate audio with different levels of diversity.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.ncrabbithole.com</i>: <a href="https://www.ncrabbithole.com/p/jack-revelle-goldsboro-nc-broken-arrow-obituary" target="_blank">An obituary for the man who saved North Carolina from nuclear disaster</a></br>On this day, January 26th, we remember Lt. Jack ReVelle, who disarmed two hydrogen bombs that had accidentally fallen near Goldsboro, North Carolina during the Cold War. On the night of January 23rd, 1961, a B-52 bomber suffered a fuel leak and broke apart, dropping two thermonuclear bombs. Lt. ReVelle and his explosive ordnance disposal team spent eight days in a muddy pit locating and defusing the bombs, holding the most radioactive part of the most powerful weapon the world had ever seen up against his chest for fifteen minutes. For decades, he couldn't tell anybody exactly what he'd done, until recently, when the story was declassified. Lt. ReVelle passed away on January 26th, 2020, after a long battle with a disease brought on by his military career. We remember him today for his courage and his commitment to protecting the people of North Carolina from nuclear disaster.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's January 27th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to the news! In today's news, a mistrial has been declared in the civil case between rapper T.I. and members of his family and MGA Entertainment. Plus, a new documentary is exploring the lack of process to report Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's sexual assault allegations and the lack of accountability within the judicial appointment system. Finally, we explore the legal gaps which empower police to collect and store massive amounts of data with little regulation. Stay tuned for more news! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.lamag.com</i>: <a href="https://www.lamag.com/citythinkblog/mistrial-declared-in-t-i-s-toymaker-lawsuit-after-race-is-introduced/" target="_blank">Mistrial Declared in T.I.'s Toymaker Lawsuit After Race is Introduced</a></br>A mistrial was declared Wednesday in the civil case between rapper T.I. and members of his family and toy company MGA Entertainment. Judge James V. Selna declared the mistrial after a video deposition of a former MGA customer was played for the jury, which discussed the corporation's alleged appropriation of Black culture. MGA's lawyers had objected to the testimony, saying it was prejudicial against the company. Erin Ranahan, T.I.'s lawyer, said they had not objected to the ban on any racism talk during the trial and were surprised at the outcome. The mistrial has been declared and both parties are discussing the possibility of a second trial.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>slate.com</i>: <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/01/new-kavanaugh-documentary-what-it-will-do.html" target="_blank">New Kavanaugh Documentary: The film will do only one thing, and it is not great.</a></br>In the wake of Christine Blasey Ford's allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a new documentary, Justice, examines the lack of a process for citizens to report such allegations, and the lack of a neutral fact-finding entity to investigate them. Director Doug Liman and writer-producer Amy Herdy have now announced that they are restarting their investigation, with the film reverting back to a work in progress. However, even if new facts or evidence are revealed, there is still no formal political or legal engine to bring about accountability or change in the judicial appointment system.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.bostonreview.net</i>: <a href="https://www.bostonreview.net/articles/without-warrant/" target="_blank">Without Warrant: Yawning gaps in the law empower police to collect and store massive amounts of data, all on the grounds that it might one day turn out useful.</a></br>Recent technological advancements in law enforcement have raised questions about individual privacy and the lack of regulation on data collection. Police are now able to collect massive amounts of data by using geofencing, facial recognition databases, automated license plate readers, and predictive algorithms to identify potential suspects. According to two recent books, Virtual Searches and Predict and Surveil, the Fourth Amendment's protection against "unreasonable searches and seizures" often does not extend to these new forms of data collection. This has created an environment of virtually no checks on how law enforcement agencies use the data they collect. As privacy and civil liberties advocates call for more oversight, law enforcement agencies continue to embrace these new technologies.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4335545" target="_blank">The Dead Hand of a Silent Past: Bruen, Gun Rights, and the Shackles of History</a> by Jacob D. Charles. The paper examines the Supreme Court decision New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen in 2022 which declared that future Second Amendment challenges should be evaluated solely with reference to text, history, and tradition. Charles's paper critiques the novel test, raises concerns about it, and suggests judicial and legislative responses.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's January 26th, 2023.</p>

<p>Good day, everyone! It's Max, bringing you the scoop on the latest news from around the world. First up, we've got a fascinating look at the world's first 'robot lawyer' and its potential implications for the legal world. We've also got an inside look at The New York Times Company and its various offerings, plus an announcement from Facebook about the end of the two-year suspension of Donald Trump's accounts. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.techdirt.com</i>: <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/01/24/the-worlds-first-robot-lawyer-isnt-a-lawyer-and-im-not-sure-its-even-a-robot/" target="_blank">The World’s First Robot Lawyer Isn’t A Lawyer, And I’m Not Sure It’s Even A Robot</a></br>This article examines the use of DoNotPay, an AI service that is advertised as a legal tool, but has been found to be inadequate and potentially damaging. After signing up for an account and using the service to generate legal documents such as a defamation demand letter, divorce settlement agreement and a small claims court lawsuit, the author found that the documents were of poor quality, did not consider legal nuances such as jurisdiction, and included inaccurate information.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/25/opinion/alec-baldwin-rust-5th-amendment.html" target="_blank">Opinion | Alec Baldwin Didn’t Have to Talk to the Police. Neither Do You. </a></br>Alec Baldwin is facing possible criminal charges for the death of a cinematographer on the set of the movie "Rust" in New Mexico in October 2021. Baldwin has admitted to talking to the police without an attorney present. Defense lawyers have said Baldwin's case should serve as a reminder for people involved in serious incidents to not talk to the police without legal representation. Prosecutors are accusing Baldwin of violating his legal responsibility to use the gun safely, which could incriminate him. Professor James Duane of Regent Law School has argued that people should exercise their right to remain silent, since it is difficult to navigate the dangers of talking to the police, and prosecutors may only present damaging statements from an interrogation.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>about.fb.com</i>: <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/01/trump-facebook-instagram-account-suspension/" target="_blank">Ending Suspension of Trump’s Accounts With New Guardrails to Deter Repeat Offenses (Meta)</a></br>We will be lifting the two-year suspension of former US President Donald Trump’s Facebook and Instagram accounts in the coming weeks, with new guardrails in place to deter repeat offenses. This decision follows the Oversight Board’s criticism of the suspension and the need for a more proportionate response. The organization determined that the risk to public safety has sufficiently receded, and that the two-year timeline should be adhered to. All public figures will face heightened penalties for repeat offenses, and posts that could contribute to risk may have their distribution limited or be removed.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4335905" target="_blank">ChatGPT Goes to Law School</a> by Jonathan H. Choi, Kristin E. Hickman, Amy Monahan, and Daniel Schwarcz. In this study, the authors used the widely publicized AI model ChatGPT to generate answers on four real exams at the University of Minnesota Law School. They found that over 95 multiple choice questions and 12 essay questions, ChatGPT performed on average at the level of a C+ student, achieving a low but passing grade in all four courses. The authors discussed the implications of their results for legal education and lawyering, as well as providing example prompts and advice on how ChatGPT can assist with legal writing.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's January 25th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to the news roundup! First up, artists are suing developers of AI tools over copyright infringement. But could their legal theories and facts be wrong? We'll explore. Next, we'll look at how the Friedman doctrine leads to the "enshittification" of all things. And finally, M&M's are making a radical change to their ads, replacing their cartoon characters with actress Maya Rudolph. Will it be enough to appease their critics? Stay tuned to find out! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>copyrightlately.com</i>: <a href="https://copyrightlately.com/artists-copyright-infringement-lawsuit-ai-art-tools/" target="_blank">Artists Attack AI: Why The New Lawsuit Goes Too Far</a></br>A group of artists has filed a first-of-its-kind copyright infringement lawsuit against the developers of popular AI art tools. The lawsuit alleges that AI-generated art is a threat to creative livelihoods, but its legal theories and facts may not be accurate. The lawsuit claims that AI tools are a "21st-century collage tool" that remixes the copyright works of millions of artists, but AI tools actually use training images to create entirely new works. The lawsuit also misrepresents how AI tools store images, and claims that all outputs of AI tools are derivative works, which is legally suspect.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.techdirt.com</i>: <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/01/24/how-the-friedman-doctrine-leads-to-the-enshittification-of-all-things/" target="_blank">How The Friedman Doctrine Leads To The Enshittification Of All Things</a></br>In a recent article exploring the "enshittification" of social media, Cory Doctorow outlines a process through which large companies eventually hit the "enshittification" stage. This process involves companies initially catering to their users in order to gain success, eventually having to pay back venture capitalists, and then struggling to please Wall Street with ever-increasing revenue and profit growth. Ultimately, this leads to companies seeking to capture all the value for themselves, in an effort to "maximize profits for shareholders" and appease Wall Street's short-term focus. As a result, companies may sacrifice long-term sustainability and profits, leading to users searching elsewhere.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/23/business/m-m-candy-controversy-tucker-carlson.html" target="_blank">Maya Rudolph Will Replace M&Ms Characters in Ads After Backlash</a></br>Mars Wrigley announced an indefinite pause from its “spokescandies,” cartoon characters that have been featured in the company’s ads for decades. This decision came after figures on the political right criticized the candy as “Woke M&M’s” because of cosmetic tweaks made in recent years. Mars Wrigley has decided to replace the spokescandies with actress and “Saturday Night Live” alum, Maya Rudolph. The decision has caused a controversy with Tucker Carlson of Fox News claiming that the candy is "unappealing and totally androgynous." M&M's has responded by saying that they are "all about bringing people together.”</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4334425" target="_blank">Defeating the Empire of Forms</a> by David A. Hoffman. For generations, contract scholars have tried to combat form contracts, which are seen as unread and full of terms that courts won't or shouldn't enforce. While these contracts have become a major part of modern commercial life, the article argues that their prevalence is itself an issue that requires a new diagnosis and reform. Hoffman proposes a statute of frauds which would make low-stakes written form contracts unenforceable. He argues that this would reduce the supply of cheap forms, externalize fewer harms, and protect important legal values.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's January 24th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's news roundup. We start off with an unprecedented case as a former high-level FBI official has been indicted on money laundering charges. In other news, a landmark free expression win has been granted to Lithuania's LGBTQI+ community, and we'll discuss Utah's plans to sue major social media companies over harms to children. So stay tuned for all the latest updates! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/23/nyregion/fbi-money-laundering-charles-mcgonigal.html" target="_blank">Former Top FBI Official in New York Charged in Money Laundering</a></br>Former high-level FBI official Charles McGonigal has been indicted in New York and Washington, D.C. on charges of taking money from a former foreign intelligence service agent and conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Russia by taking secret payments from a Russian oligarch, Oleg V. Deripaska. McGonigal had broken U.S. law by agreeing to help Deripaska attempt to get off the sanctions list and by investigating a rival oligarch. The charges are an unprecedented case and demonstrate that the reach of Russia’s oligarchs can extend into the heart of American law enforcement.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.article19.org</i>: <a href="https://www.article19.org/resources/lithuania-free-expression-lgbtqi/" target="_blank">Lithuania: landmark free expression win for LGBTQI+ community</a></br>Today, the European Court of Human Rights ruled in favour of Neringa Dangvydė Macaté, an openly gay children’s book author, whose fairy-tale book including stories of same-sex couples was marked with a warning label stating that the content ‘might have a negative effect on persons below the age of fourteen’. The Court found that placing the warning label violated freedom of expression of the author and access to information of children. This judgement is a landmark victory for the LGBTQI+ community in Lithuania and a strong statement against discrimination.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.ksl.com</i>: <a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/50563507/utah-plans-to-sue-social-media-companies-for-alleged-harms-to-children-teens" target="_blank">Utah plans to sue social media companies for alleged harms to children, teens </a></br>Utah Gov. Spencer Cox announced plans to sue major social media companies over the alleged harms to children, such as the potential damage to mental health and lack of parental controls. Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes said that lawsuits have yet to be filed, but the state is considering "any and all" claims against various platforms. Cox also asked that companies provide better parental controls, require age verification, and limit younger people from creating accounts.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4075153" target="_blank">A Free Press Without Democracy</a> written by Erin Carroll. The paper discusses how the press needs to better prepare themselves to resist and weather a turn to autocracy by overcoming certain pathologies such as American press exceptionalism, Darwinian in-group competition and an addiction to audience desire. It suggests implementing certain practices of press freedom to build resilience against autocratic regimes.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's January 23rd, 2023.</p>

<p>Greetings, citizens of the world! This is Max, bringing you the latest news. Today, we're looking at three different stories. The Supreme Court could threaten press freedoms established in the landmark case of New York Times v. Sullivan. We'll look at why a proposed federal bill could help protect these freedoms. We'll also be discussing the implications of deepfakes in the court system, and how school librarians across the country are facing restrictions on book orders. Be sure to tune in! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>slate.com</i>: <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2023/01/new-york-times-sullivan-supreme-court-defamation-law.html" target="_blank">New York Times v. Sullivan and freedom of the press is under threat from the Supreme Court.</a></br>This article discusses the importance of New York Times v. Sullivan, a landmark Supreme Court case from nearly 60 years ago. It established a precedent for the robust protection of free speech and press rights, but has recently been attacked by conservative legal figures and two current Supreme Court justices. The authors of the article propose a solution: the Freedom of Speech and Press Act, a federal bill that would codify the ruling of Sullivan and other press protections. The article further discusses the impact Sullivan has had on protecting speech, including protecting political cartoons and preventing the prosecution of journalists.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.counselmagazine.co.uk</i>: <a href="https://www.counselmagazine.co.uk/articles/deepfakes-in-the-courts" target="_blank">Deepfakes in the courts</a></br>This article explores the implications of deepfake evidence in legal cases, particularly in family law, criminal fraud, and banking authentication systems. It suggests that courts may need to increase the level of authentication required for video evidence and that duties of care might be imposed on lawyers and other professionals to have evidence verified by an independent forensic expert. Finally, it proposes increased sanctions for introducing false evidence.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.washingtonpost.com</i>: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/01/22/students-want-new-books-thanks-restrictions-librarians-cant-buy-them/" target="_blank">Students want new books. Thanks to restrictions, librarians can’t buy them.</a></br>School librarians across the United States are facing restrictions on book orders that have led to fewer books being available to students. Many states have passed laws giving parents more power over which books appear in libraries, while school districts have increased administrative or parental oversight of acquisitions. This has caused some students, especially those who are LGBTQ, to not be able to find books featuring characters like them. Those who support the more stringent book-purchasing guidelines argue that it will lead to more “pristine” school libraries, while others argue that it will lead to gaps in learning.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2380661" target="_blank">The Use and Abuse of Labor's Capital</a> and is written by David H. Webber. This article examines how public pension funds can invest against the economic interests of their own participants and beneficiaries and the legal implications of these investments. It focuses on the use of public pensions to fund privatization of public employee jobs, and the interpretation of the fiduciary duty of loyalty from ERISA and similar state pension codes. The article proposes that public pension funds be governed by a "member-first" view of fiduciary duty focused on the economic interests of public employees in their retirement funds.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's January 22nd, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's news! In the Supreme Court inquiry, phones have been seized, and affidavits have been signed, but distrust remains. Meanwhile, many of the abortion bans enacted since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade include exceptions, but they're rarely granted. And finally, Suffolk University Law School is looking for a Fair Housing Test Coordinator to join their team and help identify and prevent housing discrimination.  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/21/us/supreme-court-investigation.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare" target="_blank">Inside the Supreme Court Inquiry: Seized Phones, Affidavits and Distrust</a></br>The Supreme Court's investigation into the abortion opinion leak has caused disillusionment amongst current and former employees, and a lower public confidence in the Court. According to a report, 97 workers were interviewed, but the justices and their spouses weren't, until a statement was issued by the Court. Following the statement, public reaction was scathing. The Court was then forced to issue another statement, clarifying that the justices had in fact been questioned, but not in the same manner as other employees. This has further raised concerns about a double standard for the justices.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/01/21/us/abortion-ban-exceptions.html" target="_blank">Most Abortion Bans Include Exceptions. In Practice, Few Are Granted.</a></br>A review of state data and interviews with dozens of physicians, advocates and lawmakers has revealed that very few exceptions to the abortion bans enacted in about half the states since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade have been granted. Those unable to access abortions despite qualifying for an exception must travel to states where abortion is still broadly legal or obtain abortion pills at home. Doctors and hospitals are turning away patients, citing ambiguous laws and the threat of criminal penalties. Abortion opponents say the laws are working as intended, while abortion-rights advocates argue that legal exceptions do nothing but make abortion bans appear more reasonable than they really are.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>jobs.jobvite.com</i>: <a href="https://jobs.jobvite.com/suffolkuniversity/job/oPH9mfwL" target="_blank">Suffolk University Careers - Fair Housing Test Coordinator, Clinical Fellow</a></br>The Suffolk University Law School Housing Discrimination Testing Program is seeking an attorney for a remote full-time clinical fellowship position to coordinate fair housing testing designed to identify and prevent housing discrimination in thirteen communities throughout the WestMetro region. The successful candidate must be highly motivated, organized, and have a passion for civil rights and fair housing. This is a grant funded position for approximately two years, but may continue beyond that if additional funding becomes available. Suffolk University is an affirmative action, equal opportunity employer and especially encourages applications from historically marginalized or underrepresented groups.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1926162" target="_blank">Visual Invention</a> by Sarah Burstein. This article argues that the Federal Circuit's test for design patent nonobviousness is flawed and proposes changes to it. It also aims to provide clarity to the area of law and promote its policy goals.</p>

<p>It's January 21st, 2023.</p>

<p>Good day! Today we look at how Ron DeSantis is setting the terms for our understanding of him, a trio of artists suing AI image generators, and a confidential document that reveals the key human role in gunshot technology. Stay tuned! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.notesfromcalicomanor.com</i>: <a href="https://www.notesfromcalicomanor.com/2023/01/19/press-lets-desantis-define-himself/" target="_blank">Who sets the terms for our understanding of Ron DeSantis </a></br>This article examines the lack of journalistic coverage of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis before the publication of his upcoming book. The author suggests that without this background coverage, DeSantis is able to set the terms for the public's understanding of him. The article also features a list of useful pieces of coverage of DeSantis published prior to the book's release.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.buzzfeednews.com</i>: <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/ai-art-generators-lawsuit-stable-diffusion-midjourney" target="_blank">Meet The Trio Of Artists Suing AI Image Generators</a></br>This lawsuit is being brought against three companies - Stability AI, Midjourney, and DeviantArt - by three artists, Kelly McKernan, Karla Ortiz, and Sarah Andersen. The plaintiffs allege that Stable Diffusion, an AI model that allows anyone to generate professional quality images with a simple text prompt, was trained on billions of images scraped from the web without consent, including images owned by the trio of artists. A second suit by Getty Images has also been filed against Stability AI for allegedly copying and processing millions of images protected by copyright. If these suits are successful, it could significantly undermine the viability of tools like Stable Diffusion.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>apnews.com</i>: <a href="https://apnews.com/article/shotspotter-artificial-intelligence-investigation-9cb47bbfb565dc3ef110f92ac7f83862" target="_blank">Confidential document reveals key human role in gunshot tech </a></br>This news piece examines the use of artificial intelligence and human discretion by the company ShotSpotter to detect gunfire in 140 cities across the United States. The confidential document obtained by the Associated Press outlines how ShotSpotter employees overrule and reverse the algorithm's determinations to classify a sound as gunfire. Experts fear that the short time pressure and broad discretion given to ShotSpotter employees could lead to more false positives. The document was released from a protective order in a Chicago court case in which police and prosecutors used ShotSpotter data as evidence. ShotSpotter has long resisted calls to open its operations to independent scientific scrutiny.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4174200" target="_blank">Trial by Internet: A Randomized Field Experiment on Wikipedia’s Influence on Judges’ Legal Reasoning</a> by Neil Thompson, Brian Flanagan, Edana Richardson, Brian McKenzie and Xueyun Luo. This paper investigates the influence of Wikipedia articles on legal decisions, using a randomized field experiment to determine causal effects. The results of their experiment showed that Wikipedia shapes judicial behavior, with judges citing the relevant legal cases more often and talking about them in ways comparable to how the Wikipedia authors had framed them. This reveals a policy gap, as easily accessible, user-generated online content is already being relied on.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's January 20th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's news roundup! We've got the Supreme Court's investigation into the leak of a Roe v. Wade-overturning draft opinion, a seditious conspiracy trial involving the Proud Boys, and the Republican Party's embrace of dishonesty and fraud. Stay tuned for all the details! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.washingtonpost.com</i>: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/01/19/supreme-court-leak-roberts/" target="_blank">Supreme Court Dobbs leak: probe finds no hack, can't identify leaker </a></br>The Supreme Court announced Thursday that it was unable to identify the individual who leaked a draft opinion that overturned Roe v. Wade last spring. After months of investigation and interviews, no one confessed to publicly disclosing the document and none of the available evidence could identify any individual as the source of the document. The court also recommended new procedures and policies to address security lapses.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>terikanefield.com</i>: <a href="https://terikanefield.com/another-seditious-conspiracy-trial/" target="_blank">Another Seditious Conspiracy Trial </a></br>This trial is a big deal because it is the closest thing to a charge of treason that the US Constitution defines. Five defendants are on trial for seditious conspiracy and related felonies. Prosecutors say they were part of a "pro-Western fraternal organization" that called for the use of force against the government to oppose the lawful transfer of presidential power. They are accused of promoting violence on social media, encouraging members of their organization to attend a protest in Washington DC, and fundraising to support their activities. Charles Donohoe, the leader of the North Carolina chapter of the Proud Boys, has already pleaded guilty to Conspiracy and Assault Charges and is cooperating with the government's investigation.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.democracydocket.com</i>: <a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/opinion/santos-mccarthy-and-the-shameless-republican-party/" target="_blank">Santos, McCarthy and the Shameless Republican Party </a></br>Republican Party leaders have embraced dishonesty and fraud, exemplified by Representative George Santos, who lies without shame. The embrace of fraud and cheating by the Republican Party has led to a decline in shared decency, which is necessary for democracy to function. Representative Kevin McCarthy's recent appointment of Santos to two House committees shows that the party has no intention of restoring honor and dignity to their party.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3789156" target="_blank">Short Sellers, Short Squeezes, and Securities Fraud</a> by Christine Hurt and Paul J. Stancil. This paper explores the questions of when and whether short sellers and other atypical traders should benefit from the securities fraud class action structure. It looks at the modern securities fraud class action lawsuit and how the Supreme Court assumed that almost all investors purchase and sell securities based on their belief that the market price is accurate. The article creates a theoretical and normative framework for atypical investors in the securities fraud paradigm and examines the implications of short sellers becoming more and more visible in class actions.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's January 19th, 2023.</p>

<p>Hey there, it’s Max. Today, we’ve got a story about Governor Kathy Hochul of New York and her push to put a prosecutor on the state’s high court, despite pushback from within her own party. Then, we’re looking at OpenAI’s use of Kenyan workers on less than two dollars an hour. And finally, we’re exploring the House GOP’s ‘Weaponization of the Federal Government’ subcommittee, which looks like it won’t be a friend of free speech. It’s gonna be a wild one, so don’t miss it! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.lawdork.com</i>: <a href="https://www.lawdork.com/p/kathy-hochul-is-really-really-mad" target="_blank">Kathy Hochul is really, really mad Dem senators won't just put her prosecutor on New York's high court already</a></br>New York Governor Kathy Hochul is facing pushback from within her own party over her nomination of Hector LaSalle to serve on the state's Court of Appeals. Unions, abortion rights groups, and criminal justice progressives are among those opposing LaSalle, citing his decisions and lack of professional diversity. Despite this, Hochul has continued to press forward with the nomination and on Sunday made a speech in a Brooklyn church claiming that putting LaSalle's nomination to a vote was what Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. wanted. The Senate Judiciary Committee is set to consider the nomination Wednesday.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>time.com</i>: <a href="https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/" target="_blank">OpenAI Used Kenyan Workers on Less Than $2 Per Hour</a></br>This story examines how OpenAI, the San Francisco-based AI company, used Kenyan workers paid less than $2 per hour to build a safety mechanism for its AI chatbot, ChatGPT. This tool was needed to make ChatGPT less toxic, as its predecessor was prone to blurting out violent, sexist and racist remarks. OpenAI is now reportedly in talks with investors to raise funds at a $29 billion valuation. This story sheds light on the labor that goes into making AI-powered tools possible, and the precarious working conditions these workers face. [Editor's note: these summaries are made with the aid of the OpenAI's API]</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.techdirt.com</i>: <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/01/18/if-you-believe-in-free-speech-the-gops-weaponization-subcommittee-is-not-your-friend/" target="_blank">If You Believe In Free Speech, The GOP’s “Weaponization” Subcommittee Is Not Your Friend</a></br>The new Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, created by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, has been created to investigate the government’s relationship with Big Tech and to disrupt federal law enforcement investigations into Donald Trump’s interference in the 2020 election. Despite the name, this subcommittee is not fighting for free speech, but rather for the House GOP to weaponize its own authority and compel the federal government to go against the law. The hearings will likely be full of “yells and animal noises” of frustration and envy at being unable to exercise the power they crave.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4323277" target="_blank">The Right to Repair, Competition, and Intellectual Property</a> by Michael A. Carrier. This essay discusses the difficulties consumers often face when attempting to repair their products and how manufacturers have justified these restrictions by citing the need to protect their intellectual property. Carrier then explains why this justification is not persuasive.</p>

<p>It's January 18th, 2023.</p>

<p>Max here with your top stories. Get ready for some shocking news about Tesla, a look at how social media platforms failed to address extremism, and a discussion about the dangers of spyware. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.reuters.com</i>: <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/tesla-video-promoting-self-driving-was-staged-engineer-testifies-2023-01-17/" target="_blank">Tesla video promoting self-driving was staged, engineer testifies</a></br>Tesla used a 2016 promotional video to overstate the capabilities of its self-driving technology, according to testimony from a senior engineer. The video had a tagline claiming the person in the driver's seat was only there for legal reasons and the car was driving itself, but the engineer said the video was meant to portray what was possible to build into the system and not what was available to customers at the time. Tesla faces legal and regulatory scrutiny over its driver assistance systems, and the US Department of Justice has launched a criminal investigation into the company's claims.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.washingtonpost.com</i>: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/01/17/jan6-committee-report-social-media/" target="_blank">What the Jan. 6 probe found out about social media, but didn’t report</a></br>This report found that social media platforms failed to address online extremism and calls for violence that preceded the Capitol riot, despite warnings from their employees. The House committee investigating the riot avoided detailed discussion in its report for fear of offending Republicans and tech companies. The report focused almost exclusively on Trump’s actions leading up to the riot, missing an opportunity to hold social media companies accountable.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.lawfareblog.com</i>: <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/lawfare-podcast-how-spy-your-pocket-threatens-end-privacy-dignity-and-democracy" target="_blank">The Lawfare Podcast: How a Spy in Your Pocket Threatens the End of Privacy, Dignity, and Democracy </a></br>This podcast episode features Laurent Richard and Sandrine Rigaud, the authors of Pegasus: How a Spy in Your Pocket Threatens the End of Privacy, Dignity, and Democracy. They discuss the investigative effort led by 17 international media organizations which exposed how some governments use the Pegasus spyware against journalists, human rights activists, political dissidents, and others. They talk about the operational security concerns, how they coordinated the international effort, and the impact of their work.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3852303" target="_blank">Secrecy's End</a> by Oona A. Hathaway. It examines the American system of national security secrecy and its impact on national security and the public. It explores the history of the classification system, its pathologies, and its failures. Ultimately, the article proposes ambitious yet feasible reforms to the system of secrecy.</p>

<p>It's January 17th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to the news roundup! First, we’ll take a look at the tumultuous fallout of Twitterrific’s API shutdown and the need to explore open standards. Then, we’ll discuss the strain among the Supreme Court justices as they grapple with a deeply divided court. And finally, we’ll examine the use of AI artwork to avoid copyright infringement. Join me now for more of today’s stories! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>furbo.org</i>: <a href="https://furbo.org/2023/01/15/the-shit-show/" target="_blank">The [Crap] Show</a></br>The article discusses the experience of the creators of the Twitterrific app after the abrupt shutdown of the platform's API. It speaks to the struggle to cope with loss, as well as the lack of respect and dignity with which the shutdown occurred. The article also speaks to the need to explore new, open standards on the web, instead of relying on the whims of those running a "[Crap] show."</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.theatlantic.com</i>: <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/supreme-court-justices-public-conflict/672494/" target="_blank">The Supreme Court Justices Do Not Seem to Be Getting Along</a></br>The Supreme Court justices are showing signs of strain and tension in their collegial relationships, with disputes over the overturning of Roe v. Wade appearing to be the breaking point. Justices have traded barbs over the legitimacy of the court and there have been clear departures from the civility and collegiality of years past. During recent oral arguments, the justices have become increasingly acrimonious and impatient with one another, with some justices openly displaying a lack of respect.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>copyrightlately.com</i>: <a href="https://copyrightlately.com/using-ai-artwork-to-avoid-copyright-infringement/" target="_blank">Using AI Artwork to Avoid Copyright Infringement</a></br>This article explores the use of AI-generated art for license-free set decoration in motion pictures and other media productions. It examines the problem of copyright infringement when decorative items are used in a production and the resulting clearance culture. The article then looks at the potential of AI-generated art as a viable alternative, including copyright considerations and ethical and moral implications.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4188216" target="_blank">Warrantying Health Equity</a> by Heather Payne and Jennifer D. Oliva. This article discusses potential legal and policy reforms that could reign in sources of health-impairing air pollution, and proposes that the common law of property could be used to incentivize landlords to electrify. It argues that the use of typical gas appliances in leased spaces violates the implied warranty of habitability and, thereby, the common law of property.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's January 16th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's news. First up, Aaron Perzanowski is exploring the relationship between tattoos and intellectual property norms in a new article titled "Tattoos & IP Norms." Then, the Joseph Saveri Law Firm and Matthew Butterick are leading a lawsuit against three companies that are using a generative AI-art tool called Stable Diffusion. Finally, a lawsuit has been filed against Voyager Labs, alleging that the company used over 38,000 fake Facebook accounts to collect data from over 600,000 users. Stay tuned for more updates on these stories as they unfold. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>scholarship.law.umn.edu</i>: <a href="https://scholarship.law.umn.edu/mlr/292/" target="_blank">"Tattoos & IP Norms" by Aaron Perzanowski</a></br>A new article by Aaron Perzanowski published in the Minnesota Law Review titled "Tattoos & IP Norms," explores the relationship between tattoos and intellectual property norms. It is now available for download on the Scholarship Repository at the University of Minnesota.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>stablediffusionlitigation.com</i>: <a href="https://stablediffusionlitigation.com/" target="_blank">Stable Diffusion litigation · Joseph Saveri Law Firm & Matthew Butterick</a></br>This is a story about a lawsuit filed against three companies: Stability AI, DeviantArt, and Midjourney. The lawsuit, brought by three artist plaintiffs, claims that the companies' use of a 21st-century collage tool called Stable Diffusion violates the rights of millions of artists. Stable Diffusion is an artificial intelligence software product that remixes copyrighted works of art without knowledge or consent of the creators. The lawsuit seeks to prevent the harm to the market for art and artists that could be caused by the proliferation of infringing images. [Editor's note: In this editor's opinion the framing of Stable Diffusion as a "col­lage tool" grossly mischaracterizes or misunderstands how the tool works. I will attempt to provide my arguments in an upcoming paper, but I fear lawsuits like this present a grave danger to future creators despite who they claim to support. Stay tuned!] </p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.theguardian.com</i>: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jan/12/meta-voyager-labs-surveillance-fake-accounts" target="_blank">Meta alleges surveillance firm collected data on 600,000 users via fake accounts</a></br>A lawsuit has been filed against Voyager Labs, an online surveillance company, for using Facebook and Instagram to collect user data. The suit alleges that Voyager created over 38,000 fake Facebook accounts to scrape data from over 600,000 users. It claims the company was using these accounts to predict future criminal activity. The complaint also states that Voyager hid its presence from Facebook and sold the data for profit. Facebook demanded that the LAPD cease use of any “dummy” accounts in November 2021. The lawsuit seeks to permanently ban Voyager Labs from accessing Facebook's sites, and also serve as a warning to other companies against engaging in similar activities.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4321211" target="_blank">Applying the Regulatory Report Card to Tax Regulations</a> by Bridget C.E. Dooling and Kristin E. Hickman. This essay recognizes and draws upon the Regulatory Report Card methodology, developed by Ellig and McLaughlin, to evaluate the quality of regulatory impact analysis published by federal government agencies in conjunction with notice-and-comment rulemaking. It also anticipates a forthcoming study of changes to tax regulatory practices as a result of a 2018 Memorandum of Agreement between the Treasury Department and the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. The essay offers a brief typology of tax regulations, as well as a few tax-specific adjustments to the Regulatory Report Card methodology.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's January 15th, 2023.</p>

<p>Today, we take a look at a judicial pick from New York Governor Kathy Hochul, the increasing rate of law enforcement deaths due to COVID-19, and the limitations of using artificial intelligence for contract drafting. Stay tuned as we unpack these stories. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>slate.com</i>: <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/01/kathy-hochul-hector-lasalle-prosecutor-corporate-lawyer.html" target="_blank">Kathy Hochul’s Terrible Judicial Pick Sends the Exact Wrong Message to Young Lawyers</a></br>New York Governor Kathy Hochul's nomination of Justice Hector LaSalle to replace Chief Judge Janet DiFiore on the New York State Court of Appeals is concerning. LaSalle's record on the Second Judicial Department of the Appellate Division includes decisions that hamper the state attorney general's investigation into anti-abortion clinics and open organizers up to liability for protected union activities. In addition, the nomination perpetuates a lack of professional diversity on the court, as prosecutors and corporate attorneys are already overrepresented. This lack of diversity deprives the court of valuable perspectives, which can have real-world impacts on criminal sentencing and employment disputes. The New York Senate should reject this nominee in favor of one that is better suited to represent New Yorkers' values.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>abcnews.go.com</i>: <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/covid-leading-cause-law-enforcement-deaths-2022-3rd/story?id=96363324" target="_blank">COVID was the leading cause of law enforcement deaths in 2022 for 3rd year in a row</a></br>COVID-19 remained the leading cause of law enforcement deaths in 2022 for the third year in a row, according to a new report released Wednesday by the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. The report found that 226 federal, state, tribal and local law enforcement officers died last year while in the line of duty, with 70 of those deaths linked to COVID-19. This is an 83% decline compared to the 405 officers who died from COVID-19-related complications in 2021. Firearms-related incidents were the second-highest cause of death in 2022, followed by traffic-related incidents and other. Texas had the highest number of law enforcement COVID-19 deaths with 16, followed by Illinois with six.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.adamsdrafting.com</i>: <a href="https://www.adamsdrafting.com/chatgpt-wont-fix-contracts/" target="_blank">ChatGPT Won't Fix Contracts - Adams on Contract Drafting</a></br>This article looks at the impact of ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence chatbot, on the legal profession's contract drafting process. While some have experimented with using it for contract drafting, the article argues that it would not lead to better drafting. Furthermore, ChatGPT would not provide the trustworthiness and reliability that comes from a legal expert, and AI has serious limitations for contract review. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of real expertise and a willingness to change in order to improve the contract process. [Editor's note: the above summary was written by the same large language model upon which ChatGPT is based—GPT-3.]</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4165724" target="_blank">The New Major Questions Doctrine</a> and was written by Daniel Deacon and Leah Litman. This article critically examines recent developments in the major questions doctrine and highlights the Court's new approach which operates as a clear statement rule, requiring explicit and specific congressional authorization for certain agency policies. The Court has increasingly relied on three new indicia of "majorness" to determine whether an agency rule is major. These include the political significance of or political controversy surrounding an agency policy, the novelty of a policy, and other, theoretically possible agency policies that might be supported by the agency’s broader statutory rationale.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's January 14th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome back to the newsroom! We've got three stories to cover today, starting with Dungeons & Dragons fans fighting corporate greed. Then, we'll report on professors protesting the nomination of Judge Hector LaSalle to New York state's highest court. Lastly, we'll look at the Anti-Twitter Files and what they show about Twitter's efforts to protect Trump and conservatives. So grab a seat, grab your dice, and get ready for some news! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>newrepublic.com</i>: <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/169978/dungeons-dragons-intellectual-property-greed" target="_blank">Dungeons & Dragons Fans Prepare to Face Their Greatest Adversary: Corporate Greed</a></br>A major overhaul of Dungeons & Dragons' Open Gaming License is reportedly set to be released later this year, and its changes could have major implications for the gaming industry. According to its reading of the new version, the license requires independent publishers to report their financial data to Wizards and gives the company the right to siphon off a portion of their revenue past a certain level. It also gives Wizards a “nonexclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, sub-licensable, royalty-free license to use that content for any purpose.” This has sparked a considerable backlash in the D&D community and could potentially fracture the RPG industry.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>amsterdamnews.com</i>: <a href="https://amsterdamnews.com/news/2023/01/12/professors-protest-nomination-of-lasalle/" target="_blank">Professors protest nomination of LaSalle</a></br>This article highlights the concerns of professors and co-directors of the Brooklyn Law School's Center for Criminal Justice regarding Governor Hochul's nomination of Judge Hector LaSalle to the state's highest court. They are concerned with his judicial track record on the rights of tenants, workers, and people seeking reproductive healthcare, as well as his lack of sound leadership in regards to transparency and accountability of prosecutors. They cite a federal lawsuit and a Supreme Court ruling in support of their claims.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.techdirt.com</i>: <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/01/13/the-anti-twitter-files-january-6th-committee-report-shows-how-twitter-leaned-over-backwards-to-protect-trump-conservatives/" target="_blank">The Anti-Twitter Files: January 6th Committee Report Shows How Twitter Leaned Over Backwards To Protect Trump & Conservatives</a></br>The House Select Committee's report on the January 6th insurrection has revealed that Twitter leaned over backwards to protect President Trump and conservatives in general. This is contrary to the popular narrative that the company was dominated by left-leaning censors, as the report found that concerns over political reprisals were more likely to stifle action than financial ones. Former Twitter employees revealed that executives were slow to recognize the risk Trump posed in inciting future violence, and the Trust & Safety team was blocked from implementing policies to address coded language for fear of a controversial crackdown on right-wing users. These findings debunk the notion that social media companies resisted taking proactive steps to limit the spread of violent and misleading content out of concern for their profit margins.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4321152" target="_blank">A Revisionist History of Products Liability</a> written by Alexandra D. Lahav. The paper examines the risks of relying on casebooks to determine what the common law was in the past. It argues that the traditional narrative about early products law is incorrect. The paper argues that manufacturers were liable for injuries caused by their products and that courts routinely ignored or rejected privity arguments. The paper has implications for how we view the development of the common law today.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's January 13th, 2023.</p>

<p>Today we are looking at some big stories. First up, the SEC has charged Genesis Global Capital and Gemini Trust Company for their unregistered offer and sale of crypto asset securities. Then, Special Counsel Jack Smith has subpoenaed Donald Trump’s former attorney Rudy Giuliani, as well as other witnesses close to Trump, to turn over records related to disbursements from the Save America PAC. Finally, ExxonMobil is under scrutiny after a new study revealed that the oil giant privately predicted global warming correctly but then spent decades publicly disputing the science. Stay tuned! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.sec.gov</i>: <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-7" target="_blank">SEC Charges Genesis and Gemini for the Unregistered Offer and Sale of Crypto Asset Securities through the Gemini Earn Lending Program</a></br>The Securities and Exchange Commission has charged Genesis Global Capital, LLC and Gemini Trust Company, LLC with the unregistered offer and sale of securities to retail investors through the Gemini Earn crypto asset lending program. The complaint alleges that Genesis and Gemini raised billions of dollars’ worth of crypto assets from hundreds of thousands of investors, and that, following volatility in the crypto asset market, investors were unable to withdraw their crypto assets. The SEC’s complaint alleges that the Gemini Earn program constitutes an offer and sale of securities under applicable law and should have been registered with the Commission.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.emptywheel.net</i>: <a href="https://www.emptywheel.net/2023/01/12/follow-the-money-break-the-attorney-client-wall-of-obstruction/" target="_blank">Follow the Money, Break the Attorney-Client Wall of Obstruction</a></br>Special counsel Jack Smith has subpoenaed Donald Trump’s former attorney Rudy Giuliani, as well as other witnesses close to Trump, to turn over records related to disbursements from the Save America PAC, Trump’s primary fundraising operation set up shortly after the 2020 election. The subpoena seeks documents related to Rudy’s retainer agreements, as well as documents related to other Trump entities such as the Make America Great Again PAC, the Save America Joint Fundraising Committee, and the Trump Make America Great Again Committee. The Justice Department is also investigating Sidney Powell’s alleged scam, as well as other attempts to silence witnesses.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.theguardian.com</i>: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/12/exxon-climate-change-global-warming-research" target="_blank">Exxon made ‘breathtakingly’ accurate climate predictions in 1970s and 80s</a></br>ExxonMobil is under scrutiny following a new study which has revealed that the oil giant privately predicted global warming correctly but then spent decades publicly disputing the science in an effort to protect its core business. The research found that the company's scientists accurately projected an upward curve of global temperatures and carbon dioxide emissions that nearly matches what has taken place. This further highlights the role of the oil industry in delaying action on climate change and its profound implications for people around the world.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4321887" target="_blank">The New Judicial Power Grab</a> by Josh Chafetz. This essay looks into how the John Roberts-led judiciary has recently engaged in a striking power grab that goes unnoticed by scholars and public discourse. Chafetz considers the new judicial power grab in three distinct areas: election law, congressional oversight, and administrative law. The essay further looks into the dismissive rhetoric used by judges and how it has allowed them to amass a large amount of power at the expense of other governing institutions.</p>

<p>It's January 12th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's top stories! Today, we're discussing the impact of cryptocurrencies with Molly White and Jonathan Zittrain, the Finnish Parliament's rejection of the government's implementation of the Copyright in the Digital Single Market Directive, and the Institute for Responsive Government's Election Policy Progress Reports. So be sure to tune in and get the latest news on these fascinating topics! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>hls.harvard.edu</i>: <a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/events/web3-is-going-just-where-a-fireside-chat-with-molly-white-and-jonathan-zittrain/" target="_blank">Web3 Is Going Just Where? A fireside chat with Molly White and Jonathan Zittrain</a></br>A conversation between software engineer, cryptocurrency skeptic and cultural commentator Molly White and internet and society professor Jonathan Zittrain will take place today (January 12th) at 12:30pm EST. The conversation will cover the impact of cryptocurrencies on the world and what can be learned from them to build the next generation of the internet. The event is part of a discussion series to be led by White for H.L.S. Beyond in the spring.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>libereurope.eu</i>: <a href="https://libereurope.eu/article/the-fundamental-right-to-education-and-science-constitutional-law-v-copyright-law/" target="_blank">The Fundamental Right to Education and Science: Constitutional Law vs Copyright Law</a></br>The Finnish Parliament's Constitutional Law Committee has rejected the government's draft implementation of the Copyright in the Digital Single Market Directive, citing its conflict with human rights and in particular, the right to education and science. This is of particular significance given that the right to science extends to all forms of scientific activity, both commercial and non-commercial, and highlights the European legislators' tendency to equate innovation solely with the private sector. The rejection of the draft transposition also references the fundamental right of freedom of the arts and sciences and the right to education.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.lawdork.com</i>: <a href="https://www.lawdork.com/p/exclusive-new-reports-aim-to-help" target="_blank">New reports aim to help lawmakers, advocates with advancing voter-friendly policies</a></br>The Institute for Responsive Government has released their Election Policy Progress Reports, a 50-state, plus DC, review of elections policies from the 2021 and 2022 legislative sessions. The report looks at changes in voting laws and how they affect voter security, efficiency, and accessibility. It also provides recommendations to lawmakers and advocates on advancing voter-friendly policies. The reports are meant to provide insight on legislative progress and to recognize states that have done well, like Kentucky and South Carolina, and those that have backslid, like Texas and Iowa.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4284105" target="_blank">When Teachers Misgender: The Free Speech Claims of Public School Teachers</a> by Caroline Mala Corbin. The paper argues that public school teachers do not have a free speech right to deliberately misgender students in the classroom, as it would be considered government speech. The paper also states that misgendering speech fails the requirements for a government employee speech claim, as it is not a discussion of an issue of public concern and is highly disruptive to the school's mission of educating students.</p>

<p>It's January 11th, 2023.</p>

<p>This is Max with your news update. In tech news, researchers discover a vulnerability in California's new digital license plates. In politics, House Republicans have voted to cut billions of dollars from the IRS. Finally, Signs, the preeminent journal in women's, gender and sexuality studies, is celebrating its fiftieth anniversary, and seeking essays that address substantive feminist questions. Stay tuned. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <a href="https://jalopnik.com/researchers-hacked-californias-digital-license-plates-1849966295" target="_blank">jalopnik.com</a>: Researchers have discovered a vulnerability in California's new digital license plates, sold and managed by tech company Reviver. The vulnerability allowed the researchers to gain full access to users' GPS location, records, and the ability to change text displayed on digital plate displays. Fortunately, the vulnerability was quickly patched by Reviver after it was reported, and the company confirmed that no user data was leaked.</p>

<p>Next, from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/09/us/politics/house-republicans-irs-funding.html" target="_blank">www.nytimes.com</a>: House Republicans have voted to pass legislation to cut billions of dollars in funding from the Internal Revenue Service (I.R.S.). The measure, which was supported by all Republicans in the House, does not have enough votes to pass the Democratic-controlled Senate, nor will it receive approval from President Biden, who has already stated he will veto it. The money was originally intended to help the I.R.S. crack down on tax cheats, hire 87,000 I.R.S. employees and modernize its technology systems. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the legislation would actually increase the federal deficit by $114 billion. Democrats argue that the bill is a giveaway to the wealthy and corporations, while Republicans say that the I.R.S. needs a reckoning.</p>

<p>Finally, from <a href="http://signsjournal.org/for-authors/calls-for-papers/" target="_blank">signsjournal.org</a>: Signs, a preeminent journal in women’s, gender, and sexuality studies, is celebrating its fiftieth anniversary this year. In honor of this milestone, the journal is seeking to generate new questions and critical discussion about “Big Feminism” – about the role and power of feminist theory – today and into the future. From the standpoint of 1975, 2025 may appear to be a feminist pipe dream, but there have been consequential feminist debates and the emergence of new analytical and theoretical frames. Signs is encouraging transdisciplinary and transnational essays that address substantive feminist questions, debates, and controversies and is seeking essays that are passionate, strongly argued, and willing to take risks. The deadline for submissions is February 1, 2023.</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4319470" target="_blank">paper of the day</a> is entitled "The Plural Sources of Customary International Law" written by Harlan Grant Cohen. The paper aims to explore the different "theories of custom" that can be used to interpret customary international law. It uncovers three distinct concepts of custom commonly used, known as Negotiated Law, Legislated Law, and Adjudicated Law. Each of these concepts has its own sources of legitimacy and methods of interpretation, and this makes it difficult for courts to decide which custom to interpret and how.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's January 10th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's edition! Today we'll be discussing the dangers of US armed conflict without proper Congressional oversight, the consequences of relying too heavily on English in cognitive science, and Microsoft's plans to use OpenAI's chatbot technology in Word, PowerPoint, Outlook and other apps. Stay tuned for more on these stories! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/secret-war-unauthorized-combat-and-legal-loopholes-tickets-479969330187?aff=EventsNewsletter0104" target="_blank">www.eventbrite.com</a>: This online event, taking place on January 18th at 3:00 PM EST, is hosted by the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law. It will address the dangers of the US engaging in armed conflict without appropriate Congressional oversight. Through lesser-known laws, a handful of government officials have been able to act without notifying key decision-makers or the public. The panel will be moderated by Elias Yousif from the Stimson Center and will feature Katherine Yon Ebright, Oona Hathaway, and Wesley Morgan. This event offers one New York State CLE credit.</p>

<p>Next, from <a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(22)00236-4" target="_blank">www.cell.com</a>: This article describes the consequences of an over-reliance on English in the cognitive sciences. It argues that this has led to an underestimation of the role of language in cognitive processes and biases in research programs. The authors suggest that cognitive science should incorporate more linguistic diversity in its research in order to better understand the representational and computational capacities of the human mind.</p>

<p>Finally, from <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/ghost-writer-microsoft-looks-to-add-openais-chatbot-technology-to-word-email" target="_blank">www.theinformation.com</a>: Microsoft is looking to use OpenAI's chatbot technology in Word, PowerPoint, Outlook and other apps to allow customers to generate text from prompts. Microsoft engineers and researchers have been working to create personalized AI tools for composing emails and documents that remain secure. The AI-powered tools could be a game changer for more than a billion people who use Microsoft's apps, but could also be a turn-off if mistakes are made.</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4246818" target="_blank">paper of the day</a> is titled "Sri Lanka Personal Data Protection Legislation – An Overview" by Jayantha Fernando and Sanduni Wickramasinghe. This paper discusses the Personal Data Protection Act No.9 of 2022, which is the first of its kind comprehensive data protection legislation in South Asia. It examines the salient features of the legislation and its potential impact on the socio-economic conditions of Sri Lanka.</p>

<p>It's January 9th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's news update! In the House of Representatives, Kevin McCarthy struggled to gain the votes he needs to become Speaker. Meanwhile, artist Jan van Schaik is creating sculptures with LEGO bricks to explore questions of legacy and decay. Finally, the firing of an art history lecturer at Hamline University has caused controversy and debate over academic freedom and free speech. Stay tuned for more! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <a href="https://terikanefield.com/an-insurrection-by-any-other-name/" target="_blank">terikanefield.com</a>: This week in the House of Representatives, Kevin McCarthy had difficulty securing enough votes to become Speaker of the House due to a small group of Republicans who sympathized with the insurrection and helped spread Trump’s election lies. This group demanded control over House rules and other vital committees and the ability to call for a vote ousting the speaker. This is an example of what we can expect in the future, with the GOP in control of the House and the group's libertarian free-for-all ideology driving their decision making.</p>

<p>Next, from <a href="https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2023/01/lost-tablets-jan-van-schaik/" target="_blank">www.thisiscolossal.com</a>: This article introduces Jan van Schaik, an architect and artist based in Melbourne, Australia. Van Schaik is working on an ongoing art project called "Lost Tablets" which consists of 89 sculptures, each standing about ten inches tall and made entirely from secondhand LEGO bricks. Van Schaik's sculptures are inspired by monuments and buildings from around the world and are meant to explore questions of legacy and decay. The artist plans to complete the series this year, followed by the publication of a book.</p>

<p>Finally, from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/08/us/hamline-university-islam-prophet-muhammad.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare" target="_blank">www.nytimes.com</a>: This news article reports on the controversy that erupted at Hamline University in St. Paul, Minnesota, when an art history lecturer displayed a painting of the Prophet Muhammad to her students. Muslim students in the course and outside of it raised an outcry, and the university responded by firing the lecturer. However, many scholars and free speech advocates argued that the decision violated academic freedom and free speech principles. The article discusses the impact of the decision on the lecturer, the university and the student body.</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3954552" target="_blank">paper of the day</a> is The Three Faces of Control written by Ann Lipton. The paper explores the unique legal treatment of controlling shareholders under Delaware law. It argues that Delaware doctrine subjects controlling shareholders to three distinct legal obligations: (1) fiduciary duties to the corporation; (2) a unique cleansing regime in order to win business judgment deference from reviewing courts; and (3) different treatment when certain transactions involving sales of control are challenged in court. The paper suggests that a contextual approach to the meaning of control should be adopted in order to develop a more rational and consistent set of definitions.</p>

<p>It's January 8th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to the news roundup! Today we have a story about Rep. Jim Jordan's proposal to create a select subcommittee to review criminal investigations; a discussion about the legitimacy of the Supreme Court and the role of lawyers in our society; and the tale of how the writer of the poem at the end of Minecraft is dedicating it to the public domain. Stay tuned for more! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/07/gop-panel-criminal-investigations-00076890" target="_blank">www.politico.com</a>: Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) is proposing a "select subcommittee" to review ongoing criminal investigations and have access to information shared with the House Intelligence Committee. The subcommittee would be authorized by Jordan and be able to investigate how executive branch agencies interact with citizens and other government agencies. This proposal follows the Justice Department's arrest and prosecution of hundreds of rioters and two ongoing criminal investigations connected to former President Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Next, from <a href="https://legaltalknetwork.com/podcasts/sidebar/2023/01/lady-justice-with-dahlia-lithwick-part-2/" target="_blank">legaltalknetwork.com</a>: This episode of SideBar, hosted by law school deans Jackie Gardina and Mitch Winick, features Dahlia Lithwick, a senior legal correspondent at Slate and host of the podcast Amicus. Part II of the wide-ranging conversation covers the legitimacy of the Supreme Court and the critical role lawyers play in our society. Dahlia talks about her book, Lady Justice: Women, the Law, and the Battle to Save America. Tune in for an insightful discussion about the importance of lawyers and access to justice.</p>

<p>Finally, from <a href="https://theeggandtherock.substack.com/p/i-wrote-a-story-for-a-friend" target="_blank">theeggandtherock.substack.com</a>: This post is about the author writing the ending to the popular video game, Minecraft, which Microsoft bought from Mojang and does not own the rights to. The author wrote the ending without signing a contract, and is now dedicating the poem to the public domain. The author recounts how he wrote the ending for a friend, but that things didn't turn out as expected. They did not understand each other, leading Microsoft to commit the largest copyright offence in history. The author is now dedicating the poem to the public domain, so anyone can play with it.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3922907" target="_blank">paper of the day</a> is titled "Due Dates in the Real World: Extensions, Equity, and the Hidden Curriculum" authored by Sarah Schendel from Suffolk University Law School. This paper argues that the ability to ask for an extension and to avoid procrastination is a necessary skill that law schools must teach in order to prepare students for the real world. It looks at educational pedagogy, the Model Rules of Professional Conduct, cases of attorney discipline, and legal ethics to make the case for extensions in law school and in the real world.</p>

<p>Today, we're discussing the implications of digitizing cultural heritage, the Florida law that is attempting to limit the teaching of critical race theory in higher education, and a Connecticut judge suspending the law license of attorney Norm Pattis after his Alex Jones discovery mishap. Stay tuned to learn more about these stories and the potential impacts! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <a href="http://copyrightblog.kluweriplaw.com/2023/01/05/who-holds-copyright-in-3d-copies-of-repatriated-cultural-heritage/" target="_blank">copyrightblog.kluweriplaw.com</a>: This article discusses the implications of digitizing cultural heritage, including who holds the copyright of the digital copies and what happens to them when the artefacts are repatriated. The article suggests that 3D scanning may create new challenges, as the copyright of the digital copies will be determined by copyright laws, and whoever holds the copyright may have control over how the heritage is viewed and shared by the public.</p>

<p>Next, from <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/ron-desantis-florida-critical-race-theory-professors/672507/?utm_source=copy-link&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=share" target="_blank">www.theatlantic.com</a>: A federal judge has blocked the enforcement of a law signed by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis which would limit the teaching of critical race theory in higher education. However, the law has already had effects on professors who felt the need to cancel their courses discussing the subject matter out of fear of potential repercussions. The DeSantis administration has filed an appeal and is hoping to stay the injunction pending the appeal.</p>

<p>Finally, from <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/06/politics/alex-jones-lawyer-suspended-sandy-hook/index.html" target="_blank">www.cnn.com</a>: A Connecticut judge has suspended the law license of attorney Norm Pattis, who is representing right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, after Pattis allegedly released confidential court documents from the Sandy Hook case. Judge Barbara Bellis rejected Pattis' assertion that the mistake was inadvertent, and said that Pattis displayed a lack of fairness and decency in handling the sensitive information. Despite the suspension, Pattis is still part of a legal team representing Proud Boys leader Joseph Biggs.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4251921" target="_blank">paper of the day</a> is "The Case Against Commercial Casebooks" written by W. David Ball and Michelle Oberman. It highlights the benefits of using open-source, online casebooks over for-profit commercial casebooks in the legal academy. It shows how open-source casebooks are surprisingly easy to create and how they enable professors to center their personal pedagogical goals and values. Moreover, this paper outlines practical strategies for easing the transition to open-source casebooks.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's January 6th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's news! In South Carolina, abortion access has been protected as the state's Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional a law banning abortion after six weeks. Meanwhile, Idaho's Supreme Court allowed a state law totally banning abortion and forbidding it after six weeks to stay in effect. We'll also take a look at the rise in crime across the United States, and the Federal Trade Commission's proposed rule to prohibit employers from imposing noncompete clauses on workers. Stay tuned for details! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/south-carolinas-top-court-strikes-down-states-6-week-abortion-ban-2023-01-05/" target="_blank">www.reuters.com</a>: South Carolina's Supreme Court has ruled that a state law banning abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy was unconstitutional, while Idaho's Supreme Court found that the state constitution did not protect a right to abortion. The rulings come after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the Roe v. Wade decision in June, leaving the fate of abortion access to be determined by state law. In South Carolina, the gestational limit on abortion is now 22 weeks, while in Idaho, laws that totally ban abortion and forbid abortion after six weeks are allowed to remain in effect. The former decision is a major victory for abortion rights supporters in the U.S South.</p>

<p>Next, from <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/myths-and-realities-understanding-recent-trends-violent-crime?fbclid=IwAR1usTARDeuGU_5z_ns6Q3BJXk5l5vA684kHNUXpNopg600K2SjGUlqCGtA" target="_blank">www.brennancenter.org</a>: The recent rise in crime has been seen across the United States in 2020, with murder rates increasing by nearly 30%. Poor and disadvantaged communities have been disproportionately affected. However, despite politicized claims, the rise in murder rates was similar in cities run by Democrats and Republicans. Property crime has decreased, while gun assault and motor vehicle theft have increased. It is too soon to tell with certainty why crime has risen over the last two years, but researchers are beginning to identify contributing factors.</p>

<p>Finally, from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/01/05/ftc-noncompete-ban-lina-khan/?utm_campaign=wp_post_most&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&wpisrc=nl_most&carta-url=https%3A%2F%2Fs2.washingtonpost.com%2Fcar-ln-tr%2F38bc11f%2F63b70842ef9bf67b234bebad%2F5a3d5f28ade4e25c8fa4d234%2F36%2F72%2F63b70842ef9bf67b234bebad&wp_cu=5390e2dff16930e1d1c31f3dd14d7ffa%7C60F39CD2CA595B9DE0530100007FE2F3" target="_blank">www.washingtonpost.com</a>: The Federal Trade Commission has proposed a rule to prohibit employers from imposing noncompete clauses on workers. The ban would make it illegal for companies to enter into noncompete contracts with employees or continue to maintain such contracts if they already exist and would open up new job opportunities for 30 million Americans and raise wages by $300 billion a year. The proposed rule is based on an initial finding that noncompete clauses violate Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and has been met with outrage from some parts of the business community.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4298626" target="_blank">paper of the day</a> is titled "Diversity Washing" and is written by Andrew Baker, David F. Larcker, Charles McClure, Durgesh Saraph, and Edward M. Watts. The paper looks at whether U.S. publicly traded corporations opportunistically use voluntary disclosures about their commitments to employee diversity. It finds discrepancies between companies' disclosed commitments and their actual employee gender and racial diversity, and that firms that discuss diversity more than their actual employee diversity warrants are classified as “diversity washers." It also finds that diversity-washing firms obtain superior scores from environmental, social, and governance (ESG) rating organizations and attract investment from institutional investors with an ESG focus, despite their increased risk of discrimination violations.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's January 5th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome back, friends! Our big stories today cover a range of topics from the creative to the chaotic. First, we’re taking a look at a LEGO Ideas submission for the popular meme ‘This is Fine’. Then, we’re investigating the implications of artificial intelligence-powered chatbot technology in New York City classrooms. And finally, we’re diving into the potential chaos that could arise if the Supreme Court adopts the ‘independent state legislature theory’ in Moore v. Harper. So, stay tuned to find out more about these stories! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/a6a24359-d8d3-4276-97a0-3c998deb1206" target="_blank">ideas.lego.com</a>: A LEGO builder, legotruman, has created a model of the popular meme, 'This is Fine' (the one where the dog is sitting in a burning room drinking a coffee), as a full set and submitted it to LEGO Ideas. Voters can express their support and leave feedback for the creator based on three criteria - Originality, Building Techniques and Details. Voting takes just two minutes and is completely free.</p>

<p>Next, from <a href="https://ny.chalkbeat.org/2023/1/3/23537987/nyc-schools-ban-chatgpt-writing-artificial-intelligence" target="_blank">ny.chalkbeat.org</a>: New York City students and teachers can no longer access ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence-powered chatbot, on education department devices or internet networks. The technology has sparked fears among some schools and educators that their writing assignments could soon become obsolete. The education department has blocked access to the program due to concerns about negative impacts on student learning, and the potential for cheating and plagiarism. However, some educators have argued that the program could actually be beneficial in some cases. Meanwhile, other districts are still weighing how to respond to the arrival of the dynamic new technology. [Editor's note: the Large Language Model behind ChatGPT is the same one used to summarize the articles here.]</p>

<p>Finally, from <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/there-no-lite-version-independent-state-legislature-theory" target="_blank">www.brennancenter.org</a>: This article warns of the potential chaos that could arise if the Supreme Court adopts the so-called "independent state legislature theory" in Moore v. Harper. It states that this theory could eliminate the system of checks and balances that has been in place for over two centuries and upend state laws that protect the right to vote, such as those that guarantee absentee ballots, automatic voter registration, and equal protection of the law. The article suggests that these "compromise" positions put forward by the gerrymanderers would not limit the damage and ultimately lead to the most extreme result of the theory.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4032912" target="_blank">paper of the day</a> is "The Antibody Patent Paradox" by Mark A. Lemley and Jacob S. Sherkow. This paper discusses the increasing use of patents to protect antibodies and the accompanying implications for innovation. The authors argue that the Federal Circuit has recently increased requirements for patentees to disclose or teach how to make and use the “full scope” of their inventions, which has had an unexpected effect on the patentability of antibodies. They suggest a middle ground approach of using means-plus-function claims and infringement by the equivalents to limit patentees to claiming only the specific structural features of antibodies they both possessed and described, but also entitled them to assert their patents against antibodies with equivalent functions but different structural characteristics.</p>

          <![CDATA[<p>TRANSCRIPT WITH LINKS:</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's January 4th, 2023.</p>

<p>This is Max with a rundown of today's top stories. First, ransomware attacks on healthcare providers are on the rise. Researchers have found that these attacks have doubled since 2016 and have exposed the protected health information of over two hundred thousand patients. Next, California's high-speed rail project has been delayed for a long time, and now Governor Newsom is campaigning to release funds to jump-start the project. Finally, the UK government is looking into new anti-strike legislation that could affect public sector workers. Stay tuned for more on these stories as they develop. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/new-data-quantifies-ransomware-attacks-healthcare-providers" target="_blank">www.lawfareblog.com</a>: This article discusses the growing threat of ransomware attacks on healthcare providers in the U.S. Data collected by researchers shows that the number of ransomware attacks has more than doubled since 2016 and the average attack in 2021 exposed the protected health information of 229,000 patients. The article also explains the shortcomings of the current reporting requirements and offers suggestions for improving data collection.</p>

<p>Next, from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/29/california-high-speed-rail-bullet-train" target="_blank">www.theguardian.com</a>: California's high-speed rail project, originally planned to connect Los Angeles and San Francisco, has been delayed for 14 years and is facing a budget increase. Governor Gavin Newsom is now focusing on a 172-mile segment connecting medium-sized cities in the Central Valley, but that won't be finished until 2030 at the earliest. Optimists hope the stretch will prove to be a proof of concept, but there are many who believe the project is a boondoggle and a waste of money. Newsom is now campaigning for the release of the remaining $4.2bn in the 2008 bond fund to jump-start the project.</p>

<p>Finally, from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/02/unions-expected-to-take-legal-action-against-rishi-sunaks-anti-strike-laws" target="_blank">www.theguardian.com</a>: The government is exploring new anti-strike legislation that would require at least 20% of rail services to run during strikes. This legislation could be extended to include public sector workers such as NHS staff, teachers, fire services, and border force. Unions are expected to take legal action against the laws, as they believe it will not solve the problem of low pay. The legislation may be introduced soon after the return of Parliament, though it is likely to be challenged in court by unions.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4300663" target="_blank">paper of the day</a> is "On Bob Dylan" by Cass R. Sunstein. The paper explores Bob Dylan's refusal to identify with social movements of the 1960s, and it delves into the themes of his songs such as "Desolation Row" and "The Philosophy of Modern Song". It also analyzes Dylan's distaste for whatever is rote or routine and his appreciation for the dishabituating power of music and art.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's January 3rd, 2023.</p>

<p>Hey, everyone! It's Max here with your news roundup for the day. In Atlanta, Rico Marley was arrested for possessing an AR-15-style rifle in a Publix supermarket restroom. His lawyer argued that he did nothing illegal, but the case raises questions about how to handle such situations in states with permissive gun laws. Meanwhile, the new Republican-led Congress must decide how much power to decentralize or concentrate in the hands of a few. And finally, U.S. News & World Report is revamping its law school ranking system. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/02/us/atlanta-gun-laws.html" target="_blank">www.nytimes.com</a>: Rico Marley was arrested after he was spotted with an AR-15-style rifle propped against a wall in a Publix supermarket bathroom in Atlanta. His lawyer argued that he had done nothing illegal, as Georgia's gun laws are very permissive, but he was charged with 11 felonies before his charges were reduced later to 10 misdemeanors of reckless conduct. Experts say that this case and others like it raise the question of how to handle such situations in states with permissive gun laws, where police and prosecutors have limited tools at their disposal.</p>

<p>Next, from <a href="https://firstbranchforecast.com/2023/01/02/first-branch-forecast-for-january-2023-hindsight-is-2022/" target="_blank">firstbranchforecast.com</a>: The 117th Congress was surprisingly productive and had to contend with an attempted coup and a pandemic. The incoming Republican majority must decide whether to decentralize power or keep it concentrated in the hands of a few individuals. The Omnibus Appropriations bill provided increases in defense and non-defense spending, and included the Electoral Count Act. Anti-monopoly legislation also made it into law, despite corporate pro-monopoly advocates outspending opponents.</p>

<p>Finally, from <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-news-world-report-to-revamp-parts-of-its-law-school-ranking-11672667620" target="_blank">www.wsj.com</a>: U.S. News & World Report announced plans to revamp its law-school ranking in the wake of a public rebuke by top-ranked schools. The new ranking will give less weight to reputational surveys and will not take into account per-student expenditures, and will count graduates with school-funded public-interest legal fellowships the same as other employed graduates.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4314123" target="_blank">paper of the day</a> is "African Data Protection Laws: Politics, But as Usual" by Mailyn Fidler. This paper discusses how African countries have taken different approaches to cybersecurity and data protection regulations, using each category of regulation for a different political purpose. Fidler argues that African states have used cybersecurity regulation to resist outside, primarily European, influence, while they are generally supporting the adoption of European approaches when it comes to data protection regulations. Technology laws are doing political work, just not always the same political work.</p>

<p>It's January 2nd, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to the new world of 2023! It's a brand-new year for copyright law, with a slew of popular books, films, and stories entering the public domain. It's also a wild year for cryptocurrencies, with major collapses, bridge hacks, NFT thefts, and the deflation of the NFT bubble. And finally, the Suffolk University Law School's LIT Lab is hosting a one-day hybrid conference to discuss Collaboration at Scale from legal and law adjacent communities. Stay tuned for more tech and legal news coming your way! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <a href="https://copyrightlately.com/public-domain-day-2023/" target="_blank">copyrightlately.com</a>: On January 1, 2023, a slew of popular books, films, and stories first copyrighted in 1927, including The Hardy Boys, Steppenwolf, and The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes, entered the public domain in the United States. This event was delayed by the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, which extended the term of copyright protection for works from 75 to 95 years from publication.</p>

<p>Next, from <a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/p/in-2022-web3-went-just-great" target="_blank">newsletter.mollywhite.net</a>: In 2022, the cryptocurrency world saw a series of major collapses, bridge hacks, NFT thefts, and the deflation of the NFT bubble. Major collapses included those of Terra/Luna, Three Arrows Capital, Voyager, Celsius, and FTX. Bridge hacks saw a total of $1.7 billion stolen, with the most devastating being the Axie Infinity bridge hack, which saw $625 million taken by the North Korean Lazarus cybercrime group. Meanwhile, sixteen Bored Apes were stolen from collector Todd Kramer, with an estimated 143 apes having been stolen in total. Lastly, the NFT market saw an overall decrease in interest, with collector's NFTs becoming so valueless that they could not be offloaded for even pennies.</p>

<p>Finally, from <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfO8GLq01JdjikzdgE3FMUK0VlFQeePlM56I0oGpKxlsgp0yg/viewform" target="_blank">docs.google.com</a>: The Suffolk University Law School's LIT Lab is hosting a one-day hybrid conference on April 3rd, 2023 to discuss Collaboration at Scale from legal and law adjacent communities. Potential panelists and attendees can submit ideas for topics or case studies to be included in the program. Those who sign up can also receive updates about the program as it develops.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4313817" target="_blank">paper of the day</a> is titled "Rethinking Patent Law's Exclusive Appellate Jurisdiction" written by Christa Laser from the Cleveland-Marshall College of Law. This paper proposes retaining the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to continue to hear administrative appeals in patent, trade, or other cases deemed appropriate. It suggests returning jurisdiction over all district court patent appeals to the regional circuit courts and possibly creating a National Court of Appeals between the circuit courts and Supreme Court to decide cases of all types with a need for nationwide uniformity.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's January 1st, 2023.</p>

<p>Good morning, tech and news fans! I'm your host, Max, and I'm here to give you a preview of the stories making headlines today. First up is the story of Rep.-elect George Santos (R-N.Y.), who was exposed by a local newspaper for fabricating his résumé and biography. This story should remind us all of the importance of local media and its ability to uncover the truth. Next, we have the story of Kaitlyn Joshua, a woman from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, who experienced a difficult journey while seeking medical care for her pregnancy. Finally, this year has seen some groundbreaking advancements in tech and innovation, with decentralized social media networks leading the charge. Be sure to stay tuned for more updates on these stories, and more. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2022/12/29/north-shore-leader-santos-scoop/" target="_blank">www.washingtonpost.com</a>: A weekly publication on Long Island, the North Shore Leader, uncovered the story of Rep.-elect George Santos (R-N.Y.) fabricating his résumé and biography, months before any other news outlet reported it. Despite a well-heeled and well-connected readership, the story didn't get any national attention until after the election. Santos has since apologized for misrepresenting his background and has vowed to serve out his term as a member of Congress. Local news outlets have been suffering for years, with two disappearing each week, but this case has shown just how important it is to support local media.</p>

<p>Next, from <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/12/29/1143823727/bleeding-and-in-pain-she-couldnt-get-2-louisiana-ers-to-answer-is-it-a-miscarria" target="_blank">www.npr.org</a>: Kaitlyn Joshua, a 30-year-old woman from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, has had a difficult experience seeking medical care while pregnant. After being told that one physicians' group won't see her until she's 12 weeks pregnant, she experienced cramping and bleeding at 10 weeks and visits two emergency rooms. Both failed to provide her with answers or confirm that she was miscarrying, instead offering prayers. She eventually miscarried, leaving her and her husband traumatized and reconsidering their plans to have more children.</p>

<p>Finally, from <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/12/30/new-years-message-the-opportunity-to-build-a-better-internet-is-here-right-now/" target="_blank">www.techdirt.com</a>: This year has seen some groundbreaking advancements in technology and innovation, with decentralized social media networks like Mastodon leading the charge. OpenAI has made some significant progress in AI, with their DALL-E 2 and ChatGPT projects, while the Framework laptop is providing users with more control over the devices they own. It's also been an interesting year for cryptocurrency, with the collapse of FTX highlighting the prevalence of frauds and scams in the space. All of this points to a promising future for tech and innovation in the coming year.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4314839" target="_blank">paper of the day</a> is titled "GPT Takes the Bar Exam" written by Michael James Bommarito and Daniel Martin Katz. This research documents the experimental evaluation of OpenAI’s text-davinci-003 model, often-referred to as GPT-3.5, on the multistate multiple choice (MBE) section of the Bar Exam. After hyperparameter optimization and prompt engineering, GPT-3.5 achieved a headline correct rate of 50.3% with its top two and top three choices being correct 71% and 88% of the time, respectively. These results suggest that an LLM could pass the MBE component of the Bar Exam in the near future.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's December 31st, 2022.</p>

<p>Today we dive into the fascinating world of AI and its implications for the law. Tune in to the new podcast Esquiring Minds to hear legal minds discuss ChatGPT, Robot Vanna White, and the legal implications of Donald Trump's tax records. Then, we'll examine the debate on Signal App's privacy features and the importance of privacy as a fundamental right. Finally, we'll explore Rep. Don Beyer's mission to use AI to help with suicide prevention. All this and more coming up. Don't miss it! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <a href="https://zencastr.com/z/G6yPEGun" target="_blank">zencastr.com</a>: In the first episode of Esquiring Minds, the titular minds discuss the use of AI in the law, ChatGPT, and a story of an attorney being banned from Radio City Music Hall. They also touch on Madison Square Garden's use of facial recognition to ban its owner's enemies, Robot Vanna White, Steam Deck and an article discussing the legal implications of releasing Donald Trump's tax records.</p>

<p>Next, from <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2022/12/29/Privacy-is-OK" target="_blank">www.tbray.org</a>: This article addresses the concerns brought up by Reid Blackman's opinion piece in the New York Times about Signal App's privacy features. The author argues that privacy is a fundamental right, and the threat of eavesdropping on encrypted communication is not as great as it appears. Blackman argues that law enforcement should have access to Signal conversations, but the author points out that there is no practical way to give law enforcement access to Signal without breaking privacy for everyone. Finally, the author recommends Signal as a secure messaging app.</p>

<p>Finally, from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/12/28/beyer-student-artificial-intelligence-degree/" target="_blank">www.washingtonpost.com</a>: Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) is pursuing a master's degree in machine learning at George Mason University with hopes of one day applying his AI knowledge to his legislative work. With three classes done and four to go, he expects to begin the actual graduate work by 2024. His goal is to use his AI background to focus on suicide prevention, using AI to create risk profiles that could help clinicians identify which patients may be at higher risk and may need more services. He hopes to use AI to provide warning signs that clinicians may not immediately see.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's December 30th, 2022.</p>

<p>Welcome to the world of social media, where Mastodon and other ActivityPub-based platforms are taking over. But before you join, be sure to check out the guidelines for using Mastodon's trademarks, as well as the tips and tricks for getting the most out of your Mastodon experience. And don't forget to support public libraries, which offer access to knowledge and inquiry to all, regardless of their wealth or status. Join us as we explore the world of social media and the importance of public libraries. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/trademark" target="_blank">joinmastodon.org</a>: This article outlines the guidelines for the use of Mastodon's trademarks such as their logos and name. Users must request permission from Mastodon gGmbH to use their marks in any way other than "fair" or "nominative" use and must agree to abide by the terms and conditions outlined in the article. The article also outlines guidelines for server operators, open source projects, and social media accounts.</p>

<p>Next, from <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/12/29/some-tricks-to-making-mastodon-way-more-useful/" target="_blank">www.techdirt.com</a>: Today, many people are migrating from Twitter to Mastodon and other ActivityPub-based social media platforms. To help people get the most out of their Mastodon experience, Mike Masnick shared some tips and tricks, such as using tools like Fedifinder, Debirdify, and Movetodon to find people to follow, and enabling the advanced web interface to get a multi-column view similar to Tweetdeck. He also suggests creating lists to help focus in on more interesting content and suggests the Mastodon List Manager app to make creating lists easier.</p>

<p>Finally, from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/28/usa-public-libraries" target="_blank">www.theguardian.com</a>: The public library is a sanctuary for anyone in America and a testament to what our country could one day be. It is a rare place of beauty and dignity, offering access to knowledge and inquiry to all, regardless of their wealth or status, paid for by public funding. However, library budgets are constantly under threat and Mayor Eric Adams has proposed drastic cuts to the New York Public Library system. We need to continue to invest in public libraries, to ensure that all citizens have access to the culture, learning, and knowledge that the public library offers.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3945976" target="_blank">paper of the day</a> is titled "Pandemic 'Disability Cons'" and is authored by Doron Dorfman of Seton Hall Law School. The paper discusses how the increased awareness of disability rights has resulted in a moral panic of people exploiting the law for an unfair advantage. Through the use of examples such as mask exemptions, vaccination priority, and permission to continue remote work, the paper examines how the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the schism between real versus perceived privileges granted to those with disabilities. It ultimately provides insight into the nature and scope of the fear of the disability con in order to inform more effective disability law practices in the future.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's December 29th, 2022.</p>

<p>Today, we're exploring the latest developments in the world of law, travel, and science. ProPublica is reporting on a new and unproven method of criminal conviction, while the Elias Law Group is leading the Democratic Party's legal strategy against Republican election denialism. And finally, the travel industry is launching a pan-European sleeper train service that promises to revolutionize the way we travel. Stay tuned for more on these stories! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/911-call-analysis-fbi-police-courts" target="_blank">www.propublica.org</a>: ProPublica is reporting that police and prosecutors across the country are using a new and unproven scientific method to determine guilt in criminal cases. The method, known as 911 call analysis, is based on the concept that a caller's tone of voice, pauses, word choice, and grammar can be used to determine guilt. Experts are warning that the method is inaccurate and should not be used for criminal convictions. However, some prosecutors have been using the method to win convictions in court. One man was wrongfully convicted and spent three and a half years in prison due to this method of analysis.</p>

<p>Next, from <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/12/21/democrats-elias-elections-00073595" target="_blank">www.politico.com</a>: Uzoma Nkwonta is a partner at the Elias Law Group, a firm that has become the central node of the official Democratic Party's legal strategy. After Donald Trump attempted to use the courts to change the results of the 2020 election, many Republicans have followed suit and Democrats are attempting to mount a counteroffensive. Nkwonta and his team have been tasked with protecting democratic candidates and the voting process amid a surge of election-related lawsuits. The Elias Law Group has become a powerful tool in the fight against Republican election denialism and their mission is to make sure that the Republican Party is held accountable.</p>

<p>Finally, from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/28/pan-european-sleeper-train-to-sweep-britons-to-berlin-from-may-2023" target="_blank">www.theguardian.com</a>: The travel industry is responding to rising fuel costs and climate damage with the launch of a pan-European sleeper train service in May. The European Sleeper service will offer passengers a chance to jump on a Eurostar at St Pancras and wake up in Berlin the following morning. The train will depart on 25 May and run three times each week. Prices range from €49 for a seat to €109 for a berth in a sleeper compartment. Rail aficionados have hailed the service as a triumph, and it follows a resurgence of sleeper trains across the continent.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2714081" target="_blank">paper of the day</a> is called "The Patented Design" and it is written by Sarah Burstein of Suffolk University Law School. The paper looks at the law of design patents and the nature of the protected subject matter. It argues that a claimed shape on a different type of product or a visual representation of a patentee’s commercial embodiment should not be deemed to be infringing because the patented design should be conceptualized as the design as applied to a specific type of product, not as something akin to a copyrighted “work.” This analysis has implications for the larger policy debate over how designs should be protected as intellectual property.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's December 28th, 2022.</p>

<p>Welcome to the ultimate source for all the latest buzz! First up, a Russian sausage tycoon has died under mysterious circumstances in India. Then, a man in Arizona is suing for the wrongful death of an embryo. Finally, a law professor has put together a collection of fashion-related design patents. Stay tuned! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-64101437" target="_blank">www.bbc.com</a>: Pavel Antov, a millionaire Russian sausage tycoon and well-known politician in the city of Vladimir, has died in a fall from a hotel window in India. His death comes in the midst of a series of unexplained deaths of Russian tycoons since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Reports suggest that he was in India with three other Russians and that his friend, Vladimir Budanov, died of a stroke at the same hotel two days before. Antov had denied criticising the war in Ukraine after a message appeared on his WhatsApp account last summer.</p>

<p>Next, from <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/arizona-abortion-father-lawsuit-wrongful-death" target="_blank">www.propublica.org</a>: This article discusses how a man in Arizona is suing a clinic and its doctors for a wrongful death lawsuit of an embryo that was aborted four years ago. Experts believe this rare tactic could become more common as anti-abortion groups attempt to limit reproductive rights by using "unprecedented strategies." The lawsuit could also be an attempt to intimidate providers and punish people who have had abortions. In a similar case in Alabama, a judge dismissed the wrongful death lawsuit of an aborted embryo, stating that the claims were precluded by State and Federal laws.</p>

<p>Finally, from <a href="https://designpatentlookbook.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">designpatentlookbook.tumblr.com</a>: Sarah Burstein, a law professor, has curated a collection of fashion-related design patents. The collection includes items such as handbags, shoes, slippers, Birkenstock, Jimmy Choo, wearable blankets, hoodies and snuggies, among others. It provides an insight into fashion law and the various designs and patents related to it.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4295311" target="_blank">paper of the day</a> is "Off the Rails: The Surprising Story of Smith v. Rapid Transit, Inc." written by D. Michael Risinger. The paper explores the reality of transportation in Winthrop, Massachusetts in 1941 and offers a surprising perspective on the legal dispute leading to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court's opinion in the case. The reader is presented with a discussion of evidence, burden of proof, civil and criminal procedure, legal history, probability, and statistical proof.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's December 27th, 2022.</p>

<p>Welcome. Today we’ll be discussing proposed reforms to the Insurrection Act of 1792, the growing celebration of Kwanzakkah, and the Title 42 immigration policy. The Insurrection Act is facing scrutiny after its use during the Capitol attack and the Brennan Center is proposing reforms to ensure oversight is present. Kwanzakkah is a combination of Hanukkah and Kwanzaa and is being celebrated together to combat racism and antisemitism. And finally, Title 42 allows immigration officers to deny entry at the border in the midst of a pandemic, but it is being challenged by the Biden administration. Stay tuned for more on these stories and more! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/how-fix-insurrection-act?fbclid=IwAR2Ca_f6yslMBDci2EWB331OJn7TxqnhTOfCZD8IybH1h1oBZztw-x9aSPM" target="_blank">www.brennancenter.org</a>: The Brennan Center has proposed reforms to the Insurrection Act of 1792, which gives the President broad powers to deploy the military to enforce the law domestically. The proposal, developed with experts and allied organizations, would narrowly define when the President can deploy the military and what they can do. It would also put in place mechanisms for congressional and judicial oversight. The reforms are necessary to prevent abuse of the law, as seen in the events leading up to the January 6th attack on the Capitol.</p>

<p>Next, from <a href="https://forward.com/news/529652/kwanzakkah-a-way-to-celebrate-dual-heritage-and-combat-hate/?utm_source=Iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=sundayedition_5814762" target="_blank">forward.com</a>: This article focuses on the growing celebration of Kwanzakkah, which is a combination of Hanukkah and Kwanzaa. This year, the holidays are falling close together on the calendar and this has sparked a movement of people to celebrate the holidays together in order to combat the darkness of racism and antisemitism. People are encouraged to light both a menorah and a kinara, and events are being held online and in person throughout the US. The article also focuses on the shared legacy between Black and Jewish communities and the importance of recognizing and celebrating this connection.</p>

<p>Finally, from <a href="https://stevevladeck.substack.com/p/7-title-42" target="_blank">stevevladeck.substack.com</a>: This article discusses the Title 42 immigration policy, which was put into place by the Trump administration early in the COVID pandemic and allows immigration officers to deny entry at the border in the midst of a pandemic to those suspected of potentially carrying communicable diseases. It has been criticized as a pretext for more harsh asylum policies and the Biden administration attempted to rescind the policy but was blocked by a district court ruling. Currently, an emergency application is pending before the Supreme Court, raising the intersection of immigration, COVID, and newfound state efforts to control federal policymaking.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4304442#" target="_blank">paper of the day</a> is "Myths and Reality of Patent Law at the Supreme Court" written by Mark A. Lemley of Stanford Law School and Paul R. Gugliuzza of Temple University - James E. Beasley School of Law. This paper explores the conventional wisdom of the Supreme Court's role in patent law and separates myth from reality. The authors present a quantitative and qualitative study of all patent-related Supreme Court cases since 1982 and identify specific types of patent-related cases in which the Solicitor General wins far less frequently. The findings of this paper advance our understanding of how specialization affects judicial decisionmaking and the development of the law.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It—Law, an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's December 26th, 2022.</p>

<p>Welcome, this is Max bringing you the latest news. On Christmas Eve, busloads of migrants were dropped off in front of Vice President Kamala Harris' residence in Washington, DC. Meanwhile, Lisl Auman, a 22-year-old woman currently serving life in prison without parole for a crime she did not commit, is awaiting a ruling from the Colorado Supreme Court this summer. Finally, the People's Liberation Army conducted "strike drills" in the sea and airspace around Taiwan in response to what it says was provocation from the island. Stay tuned to find out the fate of these stories and more! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/24/politics/migrants-dropped-off-vice-president-christmas-eve/index.html" target="_blank">www.cnn.com</a>: On Christmas Eve, several busloads of migrants were dropped off in front of Vice President Kamala Harris' residence in Washington, DC, in freezing weather. The migrants were from Ecuador, Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Peru, and Colombia and were given blankets and put on another bus that went to a local church. The White House put the blame for the arrivals on Texas Governor Greg Abbott, calling it a "cruel, dangerous, and shameful stunt".</p>

<p>Next, from <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2004/06/innocent-murderer-200406" target="_blank">www.vanityfair.com</a>: Lisl Auman is a 22-year-old woman currently serving life in prison without parole for a crime she did not commit. Hunter S. Thompson has been campaigning for her release for three years, and the Colorado Supreme Court is about to make its ruling on her appeal this summer. Thompson and Mark Seal expose the brutality, corruption, and arcane legal strategy that doomed Auman--who wrote to Thompson from prison--and threaten the rights of all Americans. Her family has set up a website to support her, and Thompson is trying to help her by bringing attention to her case and writing a story about it.</p>

<p>Finally, from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/china-stages-drills-citing-us-taiwan-provocation-2022-12-25/" target="_blank">www.reuters.com</a>: Reuters reported that China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) conducted "strike drills" in the sea and airspace around Taiwan on Sunday in response to what it said was provocation from the democratically-governed island and the United States. The drills showed Beijing's mentality of resolving differences by force, which Taiwan's defense ministry said was not conducive to China's international image. The United States is Taiwan's most important international backer and arms supplier, despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties. Taiwan has complained of repeated Chinese military activity nearby over the last three years or so as Beijing seeks to pressure Taipei to accept Chinese sovereignty.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4250452" target="_blank">paper of the day</a> is The Copyright Claims Board: Good News or Bad News for Communication Scholars?, written by Patricia Aufderheide and Aram Sinnreich. This paper explores the implications of the U.S. Copyright Claims Board (CCB), created in 2020, for communication scholars. The authors surveyed communication and Internet scholars to assess their willingness to take risks when challenged for fair use of copyrighted material. They found that the CCB may not serve its stated purpose due to scholars’ fear of legal entanglements, as well as their inability to protect their work in this venue. The paper concludes that the nascent CCB should be closely monitored by communication and Internet scholars.</p>
