<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's June 1st, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to the news roundup! We've got some interesting stories for you today. First off, Twitter is accused of failing to remove hate speech from its verified users. Then, Japan is boldly going all in on AI by announcing that copyright doesn't apply to data used to train AI algorithms. And lastly, the special counsel investigating former President Trump's efforts to stay in power has subpoenaed White House aides who may have been involved in the firing of the election security expert.  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.thedailybeast.com</i>: <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/twitter-fails-to-remove-hate-speech-by-blue-check-users-says-report-from-center-for-countering-digital-hate?utm_campaign=owned_social&utm_source=twitter_owned_tdb&utm_medium=socialflow&via=twitter_page" target="_blank">Twitter Fails to Remove Hate Speech by Blue-Check Users, Center for Countering Digital Hate Says</a></br>Twitter has been accused of failing to remove hate speech from its verified Twitter Blue accounts. According to research from the Center for Countering Digital Hate, 99% of hateful tweets from Blue users remain after being reported, including posts promoting neo-Nazism, antisemitism, racism, and homophobia. Twitter's algorithm is also allegedly giving priority to Blue subscribers, meaning their more extreme tweets appear higher in user feeds. Twitter's then-CEO Elon Musk is accused of prioritizing his 8-dollar a month subscription service over civil and human rights, and it is estimated that the five most infamous accounts associated with the platform generate $6.4 million in annual advertising revenue.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>technomancers.ai</i>: <a href="https://technomancers.ai/japan-goes-all-in-copyright-doesnt-apply-to-ai-training/" target="_blank">Japan Goes All In: Copyright Doesn't Apply To AI Training</a></br>In a groundbreaking move, Japan's government has recently announced that it will no longer enforce copyrights on data used to train Artificial Intelligence algorithms. This news is part of Japan's ambitious plan to become a leader in AI technology and to better compete with the West. Whilst some creators fear that AI will reduce the value of their work, the academic and business sectors are pushing the government to use the nation's relaxed data laws to propel Japan to global AI dominance.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/31/us/politics/trump-aides-subpoenaed-special-counsel.html?unlocked_article_code=DvRQS7OKSrX6AyirMzR4LIqeijyb8T6KacQLwHt7LJUaIzHDB7X1qSBpL1ykd7pPAL_zj98qFfNGp1p0LtJOV4zl40FGflWYqwdp-e6sN2V3CUPi3BBfqmIaqPeV1UBvGchXpzYLQa24yYTTvcGxAwmFmG3G1lHUB9OdHZli49L52MsTTawRrsqmprx8r3npo4NSkyGFUIoy1QiMCvk0y91Y-Lj5TT7MNkbuN5J0RBrg_gCHW3bPcjD-_4yu8pvqtggn31VaB8BBzk8AozsSThYHFIAo1Zbyevx19KQ9TKwPofCIMzfsW_pcOo_iz8YFcz5KuUYjliRcUp1yWxRVYQnEBqyJpiOV32Y5iMSGsh0jTOps&smid=url-share" target="_blank">Trump White House Aides Subpoenaed in Firing of Election Security Expert </a></br>The special counsel investigating former President Donald Trump's efforts to cling to power after he lost the 2020 election has subpoenaed staff members from the Trump White House who may have been involved in the firing of Christopher Krebs, the government cybersecurity official whose agency judged the election "the most secure in American history." The team is looking into the events leading up to the attack on the Capitol and trying to establish a timeline. It is also asking questions about the Presidential Personnel Office's efforts to test the loyalty of federal officials and potential hires.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4205317" target="_blank">Preliminary Injunctive Relief in Patent Cases: Repairing Irreparable Harm</a> by John C. Jarosz, Jorge L. Contreras, and Robert L. Vigil. This article addresses the meaning of "irreparable harm" when considering preliminary injunctions in patent cases. The authors propose a four-factor test to assess the issuance of preliminary injunctions in such cases and argue that this test will make the analysis more certain and economically sensible.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's May 31st, 2023.</p>

<p>Good day, this is Max with today's top stories! First up, we have a new article from Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society, exploring transgender law and politics. Then, we have a story from The Guardian about Trump lawyer Evan Corcoran being waved away from searching Donald Trump's office for classified documents. Finally, NOLA dot com has a story about the rise of unregulated home insurance companies in Louisiana. Stay tuned.</p>

<p>First, from <i>signsjournal.org</i>: <a href="http://signsjournal.org/catharine-a-mackinnon-exploring-transgender-law-and-politics/" target="_blank">Catharine A. MacKinnon, "Exploring Transgender Law and Politics" - Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society</a></br>Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society is an online resource for feminist scholarship and activism. The Journal features articles and multimedia resources, including an art gallery, virtual issues, and films for the feminist classroom. Additionally, Signs has recently published issues on abortion and reproductive justice, and it is currently featuring an artist, a call for papers for Lesbian Studies Now, and resources for #TheResistance. Finally, Signs has a digital archive featuring two resources related to transgender law and politics.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.theguardian.com</i>: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/30/evan-corcoran-trump-lawyer-waved-off-secret-document-search" target="_blank">Trump lawyer said to have been waved off searching office for secret records | Donald Trump | The Guardian</a></br>Lawyer Evan Corcoran, tasked with searching for classified documents at Mar-a-Lago after the justice department issued a subpoena, has revealed that he was waved away from searching Donald Trump's office, where the FBI later found the most sensitive materials. Corcoran found 38 classified documents in the storage room, but was never allowed to search Trump's office. Prosecutors are now investigating whether this was a ploy by Trump to retain classified documents. Corcoran's account suggests that Trump aides misled him as to where the materials were located.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.nola.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nola.com/news/business/louisiana-homeowners-embrace-less-regulated-insurers/article_3b250db8-fbe4-11ed-bc6c-ff3e2911801d.html" target="_blank">Louisiana homeowners embrace less regulated insurers | Business News | nola.com</a></br>A new form of insurance is gaining popularity in Louisiana, as people turn to unregulated "surplus lines" insurers to find competitively priced home insurance. Companies such as KIN, an "insurtech" company, are selling policies directly to consumers online and at lower prices than traditional insurers. However, their losses are not backed by the state if the company goes bankrupt. Consumer advocates are urging caution, questioning whether these companies will deliver on their promised claims if needed.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's May 30th, 2023.</p>

<p>Greetings everyone! It's Max, bringing you the latest news from the tech world. This week, we're talking about the hype around LLMs, Generative AI, and ChatGPT, and the effects of automation on labor and the economy. We'll also take a look at how the invasion of Ukraine has impacted Russia's tech industry. Stay tuned for all this and more - you don't want to miss it!</p>

<p>First, from <i>sarahglassmeyer.substack.com</i>: <a href="https://sarahglassmeyer.substack.com/p/im-still-not-here" target="_blank">(I’m Still Not Here) - by Sarah Glassmeyer</a></br>In this post, Sarah Glassmeyer talks about the hype surrounding LLMs, Generative AI, and ChatGPT. She finds the technology impressive, but cautions against using it to act as a band-aid for issues in the legal world. She also cautions against using public-facing general generative AI tools for creating professional legal documents without a review or independent verification of the content. Sarah provides resources and advice for safely using Generative AI tools.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>harpers.org</i>: <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2023/05/where-tomorrow-meets-today/" target="_blank">Where Tomorrow Meets Today | Harper's Magazine</a></br>In a modern twist on the 1956 General Motors promotional film, Design for Dreaming, Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee's book The Second Machine Age explores the impacts of automation on labor, productivity, and economic growth. According to the authors, automation has the potential to create both winners and losers in the economy, as well as a surplus population with no job prospects. Despite the widespread use of automation, some economists argue that real wages have stagnated since the 1970s, and that growth in the service sector is not enough to offset these losses. This, combined with the increasing use of workplace surveillance technology, paints a bleak picture of the future for those affected by automation.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.technologyreview.com</i>: <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/04/04/1070352/ukraine-war-russia-tech-industry-yandex-skolkovo/" target="_blank">How Russia killed its tech industry | MIT Technology Review</a></br>Russian tech giant Yandex, once considered the country's biggest success story, has been hit hard by the invasion of Ukraine, with more than 100,000 IT specialists leaving the country and more than 1,000 foreign firms curtailing their operations. The tech sector, which made up 3.2% of total GDP, has been set back, and Yandex has been forced to sell off its lucrative businesses and split itself into two parts. This has left Russia further cut off from the global tech industry and in a state of chaos.</p>

<p>It's May 29th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's news roundup. First up, Fox News is paying a hefty price in the form of a $787.5 million settlement following their promotion of false conspiracy theories. Then, OpenAI's AI products may be vulnerable to malicious data poisoning attacks. And finally, Chile's Atacama Desert has become a dumping ground for discarded fast fashion, creating a dangerous environmental and social crisis. </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/27/business/media/fox-news-dominion-voting.html" target="_blank">Inside Fox’s Legal and Business Debacle</a></br>Fox News has settled with Dominion Voting Systems for a record $787.5 million, ending one of the biggest legal and business debacles in Rupert Murdoch's media empire. The settlement was the result of a series of missteps and miscalculations made by Fox executives in the handling of the defamation suit, which arose from Fox's promotion of false conspiracy theories about Dominion's role in the 2020 election. The settlement came after months of embarrassing internal disclosures, the benching of Fox's top prime-time star, Tucker Carlson, and two shareholder lawsuits. Fox has yet to comment in detail on the case.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>softwarecrisis.dev</i>: <a href="https://softwarecrisis.dev/letters/the-poisoning-of-chatgpt/" target="_blank">The poisoning of ChatGPT</a></br>OpenAI’s secrecy has left its AI products vulnerable to a new form of black hat keyword manipulation called “data poisoning”. This type of attack can affect the sentiment, meaning, and quality of the output generated by the system, and can be done with as few as a hundred entries. OpenAI’s use of user-prompts to fine-tune their models also puts them at risk of manipulation. The company’s lack of transparency makes it impossible to know if their products are securely managed and safe from manipulation.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.nationalgeographic.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/chile-fashion-pollution" target="_blank">Chile's Atacama Desert has become a fast fashion dumping ground</a></br>A disturbing story is emerging from Chile's Atacama Desert, the world's driest and largest fog desert. Fast fashion clothing discarded from the developed world is piling up in the desert, creating an environmental and social emergency. Francisco Ángel, 24, scours through the garbage for brand names to sell at street markets, a weekly occurrence. The Atacama Desert is a stark reminder of the consequences of rapid mass produced clothing.</p>

<p>Welcome to the news! In today's top stories, a Manhattan judge is ordering a lawyer to show cause why he should not be sanctioned for using artificial intelligence software in a court filing. The judge has set a hearing for June 8th to determine if sanctions will be imposed. We include links to an article about the case as well as primary documents. </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/27/nyregion/avianca-airline-lawsuit-chatgpt.html" target="_blank">A Man Sued Avianca Airline. His Lawyer Used ChatGPT.</a></br>A federal judge in Manhattan has ordered a hearing to discuss potential sanctions for a lawyer who used an artificial intelligence program called ChatGPT to prepare a court filing. The lawsuit was filed by Roberto Mata against Avianca, who alleged he was injured when a metal serving cart struck his knee during a flight to JFK. Avianca's lawyers noticed the citations and quotes in the brief did not match up with any existing court decisions, leading to the discovery that ChatGPT had invented them. The lawyer has apologized and promised never to use the program again without verification. A legal ethics professor has warned that lawyers must verify the information provided by A.I. software before using it in court filings.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.courtlistener.com</i>: <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/63107798/mata-v-avianca-inc/?filed_after=&filed_before=&entry_gte=&entry_lte=&order_by=desc" target="_blank">Mata v. Avianca, Inc., 1:22-cv-01461 </a></br>Peter LoDuca, a lawyer representing Roberto Mata in the case of Mata v. Avianca, Inc., is facing potential sanctions from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The court ordered LoDuca, along with the law firm of Levidow, Levidow & Oberman, P.C., and Steven Schwartz to show cause why they should not be sanctioned for citing non-existent cases to the court and submitting non-existent judicial opinions. A hearing has been set for June 8th to determine if sanctions will be imposed.</p>

(S.D.N.Y., 1:22-cv-01461) </a></br>A Manhattan judge has ordered plaintiff's counsel, Peter LoDuca, to show cause why he should not be sanctioned for citing non-existent cases in an Affirmation in Opposition and submitting bogus judicial opinions in an affidavit. The judge is scrutinizing LoDuca's conduct under Rule 11(b)(2) and (c) of Fed. R. Civ. P., 28 U.S.C. § 1927, and the court's inherent power. The show cause hearing will take place on June 8th and LoDuca has been asked to submit a written response to the order by May 26th.</p>

<p>It's May 27th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome back. Today, we’re looking at the Supreme Court’s assault on clean water regulations; a discussion on international ESG considerations; and Twitter's demand for researchers to pay $42,000 a month for data access. Get ready for all the details, coming right up!First, from <i>www.lawdork.com</i>: <a href="https://www.lawdork.com/p/brute-force-reactionary-scotus-clean-water" target="_blank">The reactionary SCOTUS majority's assault on clean water</a></br>On Thursday, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a 5-4 decision in Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency, which drastically limits the federal government's ability to protect water from pollution by narrowing the scope of the Clean Water Act. Justice Sam Alito, with the support of Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, and Amy Coney Barrett, upended 45 years of precedent and practice regarding the Clean Water Act. Justices Kavanaugh, Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson all wrote separate opinions arguing that the majority opinion was "erroneous" and would result in decreased water quality, and Kagan went on to say that the decision was "not how the Constitution thinks our Government should work".</p>

The panel will discuss the most salient ESG issues in each jurisdiction, as well as the risks to issuers and investors and potential changes that could be made. The webinar is open to members free of charge and non-members for $15.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>inews.co.uk</i>: <a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/twitter-researchers-delete-data-unless-pay-2364535" target="_blank">Twitter is making researchers delete data it gave them unless they pay $42,000</a></br>Twitter recently sparked controversy after it demanded academic researchers pay $42,000 a month for data access, or delete all the data they had stored. This policy shift has been met with backlash from the academic community, who view it as the ‘big data equivalent of book burning’ and a threat to the transparency of the platform. The data access has been used to track conversations on Twitter, examine the spread of disinformation and misinformation, and explore the rise of extremism. With this policy change, free tools developed with the decahose data such as Hoaxy and Botometer have already stopped or are soon to stop working. Elon Musk's words that Twitter serves as the 'public town square' ring hollow in light of this policy change.</p>

<p>It's May 25th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to your daily news roundup with Max! Today, we have poet Amanda Gorman speaking out against a Florida school's decision to restrict access to her work, Elon Musk's efforts to bolster the right-wing media ecosystem, and Target pulling some of its Pride month merchandise due to backlash. We will be diving into these stories and more, so stick around!</p>

<p>First, from <i>www.axios.com</i>: <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/05/23/amanda-gorman-florida-book" target="_blank">Amanda Gorman "gutted" after Florida school restricts inauguration poem access</a></br>Poet Amanda Gorman is speaking out against a Florida school's decision to restrict access to her book, "The Hill We Climb." Miami-Dade County Public Schools said that the book is better suited for middle school students, and has been shelved in the middle school section of the media center. This move follows a federal lawsuit filed by Penguin Random House, PEN America and several authors against another Florida school district for removing and restricting books related to race and LGBTQ identity. Gorman has spoken out against the "unnecessary" book bans, which are disproportionately affecting queer and non-white voices.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.washingtonpost.com</i>: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/05/23/musk-desantis-analysis/" target="_blank">Elon Musk’s right-wing media venture scores another big win </a></br>Elon Musk's efforts to make Twitter a heavyweight in the right-wing ecosystem have recently been bolstered with two victories. His conversation with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is announcing his 2024 Republican presidential nomination on Twitter, and former Fox host Tucker Carlson's announcement that he will begin hosting a daily show on the platform. Musk has long been a fan of DeSantis and has created an environment on Twitter where hate speech and misinformation can thrive.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>apnews.com</i>: <a href="https://apnews.com/article/target-pride-lgbtq-4bc9de6339f86748bcb8a453d7b9acf0" target="_blank">Target becomes latest company to suffer backlash for LGBTQ+ support, pulls some Pride month clothing </a></br>Target has become the latest company to suffer backlash over their support for the LGBTQ+ community, and has removed some of their Pride month merchandise from stores nationwide. This follows after violent confrontations with Target workers and threats that compromised their sense of safety and well-being in the workplace. Target has also moved some of its Pride displays to the back of stores in some Southern areas after similar confrontations and backlash. Bud Light has also been struggling with backlash after partnering with a transgender influencer, and their parent company has announced a plan to triple their marketing spending in the U.S. this summer in an effort to restore sales.</p>

<p>It's May 22nd, 2023.</p>

<p>Good day, friends! We have a few stories for you today. First, a former Twitter employee is suing Elon Musk for allegedly ordering the installation of unsafe locks and electric heaters. Second, we hear from a former Trump lawyer who resigned due to conflicts with another lawyer on the team. And finally, we take a look at T. Vesting's new book, "Subjectivity Transformed," which examines how modern conceptions of personhood and legal personhood can be used to advance and secure wellbeing.  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.businessinsider.com</i>: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-exec-quit-when-told-to-install-illegal-locks-that-risked-lives-2023-5" target="_blank">Twitter Exec Quit When Told to Install Illegal Locks That Risked Lives</a></br>Six former Twitter employees have filed a lawsuit accusing Elon Musk of putting employees' lives at risk with illegal locks and heaters in Twitter headquarters' bedrooms. The lawsuit alleges that Joseph Killian, the company's former global head of construction design, was instructed to install cheaper, noncompliant locks and electric heaters that would not open in case of a fire. Killian reportedly quit after arguing that the locks would put lives at risk, and the heaters would increase the risk of a fire due to noncompliant electrical work. Twitter has yet to comment on the allegations.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/20/us/politics/parlatore-trump-lawyer-conflict.html?unlocked_article_code=EGzjlYrOU5Vh36oRJsRcxCvjw3eJJ2bKSIRY-oDzfUoI7KGGmuGL02Ij9HOVui7jPNPIc3CZct2CL_Swtw9-L5Ov2ouRy_uHLAYwn5k5tcEywV47fGuBXl5UX9FYcWUJ6Pldu3hUpf_PIGk5WVZUDyLduXprhILykz1tY5djWRlpHaLtdBanA7J3wPOeJDYyWptLPfiHF3dAUvL_KwAgMsUYSDnMPme-nad8y3SUGUS3t7r0sKygsnaRSwps1BV30BObjknbjwUqWxJrQVigrvgNPkApp_QWpMb_7ZDFCaXdqk-pCvC5bZDJG4p9_rSoYwjLY8Hf4seHrxFl_e9naWM2kYuw0emUulP1UhM&smid=url-share" target="_blank">Timothy Parlatore, Former Trump Lawyer, Describes Conflict Inside Legal Team </a></br>Former President Donald J. Trump's legal team is in disarray after Timothy Parlatore, one of his former lawyers, spoke about his resignation on a CNN broadcast. According to Parlatore, his decision was due to differences with Boris Epshteyn, another lawyer on the team. He stated that Epshteyn had hindered him and other lawyers from getting information to the former president, making it harder to defend him against the Justice Department's scrutiny. Parlatore also accused Epshteyn of trying to prevent the team from conducting additional property searches for classified documents. Jack Smith, the special counsel in charge of the inquiries, is reportedly close to a decision on whether to file indictments against Trump.</p>

<p>Finally, from drive.google.com : Foreword. In Vesting, T. Subjectivity Transformed: The
cultural foundation of liberty in modernity.</p>

<p>Thomas Vesting's new book, "Subjectivity Transformed: The Cultural Foundation of Liberty in Modernity," is a deep look into the nature of wellbeing and agency, and how government and law can advance and secure them. Drawing from sociology, philosophy, psychology and more, Vesting creates a dual taxonomy of personhood and legal personhood. He argues that any legal conception of personhood must come from conceptions of personhood latent in a society or culture, and that freedom is a matter of the functional differentiation of different spheres of action. His book examines how modern personhood is a joint enterprise, and that legal personhood must promote modern personhood's creativity and social nature to yield prosperity.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4438368" target="_blank">What 21st-Century Free Speech Law Means for Securities Regulation</a> by Helen L. Norton. This paper provides an analysis of how the Free Speech Clause Doctrine of the US Supreme Court has influenced the regulations of securities law in this 21st-Century. It considers how this doctrine could dismantle the securities law framework that has been in place since the Great Depression and the public-regarding goals this framework achieves, such as stabilizing and efficient markets, and encouraging corporate accountability. The paper argues that securities-related speech should be considered as its own category of unprotected speech, and that the regulation of such speech is consistent with the Court's longstanding tradition. Additionally, it addresses the possibility of the Court turning to the commercial speech doctrine to assess the constitutionality of securities law.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's headlines! On BBC Radio 4, they're talking about the life and legacy of Newton Minow, campaigner Lois Keith and illustrator Gerald Rose. In Montana, Governor Greg Gianforte has signed a new law to protect the state's fossil fuel industry from considering climate change when making decisions. And finally, the 'sneaker shoe' has caused a stir on social media - what's the appropriate footwear for the Oval Office? Stay tuned for more. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.bbc.co.uk</i>: <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001lz0d" target="_blank">BBC Radio 4 - Last Word, 19/05/2023</a></br>Today on BBC Radio 4, Last Word spoke to Nell Minow and Professor Hannah Fry about the life and legacy of Newton Minow, the broadcasting regulator who was appointed chairman of the US Federal Communications Commission by President John F. Kennedy. They also spoke about mathematician Vicky Neale, who responded to her diagnosis with cancer by launching a podcast about the role of maths in cancer research. They also discussed campaigner Lois Keith and illustrator Gerald Rose.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.motherjones.com</i>: <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2023/05/montana-republicans-pass-anti-climate-science-law/" target="_blank">Montana GOP Just Passed an Aggressive Law to Thwart Climate Science – Mother Jones</a></br>Montana's Governor Greg Gianforte recently signed House Bill 971, which prevents state agencies from considering climate change when reviewing large projects such as coal mines and power plants. The law has been met with fierce opposition from environmentalists, who argue that it ignores the effects of climate change. Montana is home to the Bakken formation, one of the largest onshore oil and gas fields in the US, and the state's six coal mines account for almost half of the state's electricity. Several of the state's Republican lawmakers have ties to the fossil fuel industry, and the bill could set a dangerous precedent for other red states.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/19/style/do-dress-sneakers-belong-in-the-oval-office.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare" target="_blank">Dress Sneakers in the Oval Office? These People Think Not. - The New York Times</a></br>At a photo-op in the Oval Office this week, President Joe Biden was joined by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, Senator Mitch McConnell and Representative Hakeem Jeffries, all wearing a controversial footwear hybrid known as the 'sneaker shoe'. The shoe, which has neither the street cred of a sneaker or the formality of a dress shoe, has caused a stir on social media, with many criticizing the choice for not showing the respect due an occasion in the Oval Office. Style commentators have weighed in, suggesting that men should either commit to a dress shoe or a sneaker, but not an in-between.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4422583" target="_blank">ChatGPT and Intermediary Liability: Why Section 230 Does Not and Should Not Protect Generative Algorithms</a> by Hasala Ariyaratne. It explores the legal question of whether Section 230—an internet law that provides immunity for users and platforms against claims based on third-party online content—protects OpenAI (a generative artificial intelligence technology) for ChatGPT outputs. The paper argues that in most cases, Section 230 does not protect OpenAI for ChatGPT outputs because it was designed to protect intermediaries of third-party content, and ChatGPT does not function as an intermediary but rather creates content in part by itself. It also explains counterarguments to this conclusion based on legal tests used to analyze Section 230 claims. In the end, the paper argues that it is unnecessary to immunize generative algorithms like ChatGPT at this time.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's May 20th, 2023.</p>

<p>Hello there! I'm Max and I'm here to bring you a quick preview of the top stories today. First, the Supreme Court just ruled in a case between the Andy Warhol Foundation and photographer Lynn Goldsmith, and the decision may not be what fair use supporters were hoping for. Next, a new industry is emerging that allows well-off families to buy their way into college admissions. And finally, Instagram is reportedly developing an app called P92 or Barcelona that could become an alternative to Twitter. Stay tuned for more information on these stories and more, right here. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>creativecommons.org</i>: <a href="https://creativecommons.org/2023/05/18/warhol-v-goldsmith/" target="_blank">Everything might be OK! Warhol v. Goldsmith</a></br>Today, the United States Supreme Court released its opinion on Andy Warhol Foundation v. Goldsmith, a case concerning the transformative use of Lynn Goldsmith's photograph of Prince Rogers Nelson for Warhol’s Orange Prince. The Court's focus on Warhol’s specific “use” of the photograph provides clarification on what the word “use” means for fair use analysis, and narrows the scope of the opinion. The Court’s attempt to draw a line between a derivative work and a fair use does not provide much clarity, and the decision may undervalue fair use more broadly. Ultimately, this decision is disappointing to champions of fair use, but does not appear to change much about judgments on fair use from what we’ve seen before.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.propublica.org</i>: <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/college-high-school-research-peer-review-publications" target="_blank">The Newest Way to Buy an Advantage in College Admissions </a></br>A new industry is emerging that allows well-off families to pay to put their high schoolers' research papers into print as a way to enhance their college applications. Services like Scholar Launch, which can cost up to $3,500, connect students with mentors to help them research and publish their papers. The quality of these papers and the publications they appear in can be questionable, and college admissions staff may be ill-equipped to evaluate them. Despite this, the number of programs and journals publishing high school research has grown significantly in recent years.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.theverge.com</i>: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/19/23730070/instagram-twitter-app-competitor-leak" target="_blank">This is Instagram’s new Twitter competitor</a></br>Instagram is reportedly developing a text-based app called P92 or Barcelona that would allow users to post text-based updates in a timeline-like fashion. The app would include features such as moderation controls and compatibility with other apps such as Mastodon. If the app is released, it could become an even more popular destination than it already is as people are looking for alternatives to Twitter.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4397968" target="_blank">Superstar CEOS and Corporate Law</a> written by Assaf Hamdani and Kobi Kastiel. In this paper, the authors explore the impact of superstar CEOs on corporate law doctrine and scholarship and develop a framework to understand the challenges they pose. They argue that superstar CEOs possess significant power over boards of directors, based on the belief that they are uniquely capable of producing superior returns for shareholders. The framework is used to explain CEO-board entanglements, board failures, and the failure of governance reforms.</p>

<p>It's May 19th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's edition of the news! It's a historic day for civil rights, as Nancy Abudu has been confirmed as the first Black woman on the Eleventh Circuit. We'll also take a look at the implications of two Supreme Court cases, Gonzalez v. Google and Taamneh v. Yelp, which consider amending or revoking Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. And finally, a civil rights complaint has been filed against the State Bar of California for allegedly failing to provide accommodations for taking the California bar exam.  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>blakereid.org</i>: <a href="https://blakereid.org/gonzalez-taamneh-and-section-230s-interpretive-debt/" target="_blank">Gonzalez, Taamneh, and Section 230’s Interpretive Debt </a></br>This week, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments for two cases, Gonzalez v. Google and Taamneh v. Yelp, which consider the implications of amending or revoking Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Section 230 has allowed the courts to maintain a certain degree of interpretive debt, in that a lack of case law exists on how various laws may be applied to user-generated content platforms. If Section 230 is altered, it could create a lot of extra work for the courts as they attempt to evaluate how existing law applies to modern-day platforms.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>dredf.org</i>: <a href="https://dredf.org/2023/05/18/civil-rights-complaint-filed-against-state-bar-of-california-for-failing-to-provide-an-accessible-bar-exam/" target="_blank">Civil Rights Complaint Filed Against State Bar of California for Failing to Provide an Accessible Bar Exam </a></br>Today, four law school graduates with disabilities have filed a civil rights complaint with the United States Department of Justice against the State Bar of California for allegedly violating the Americans with Disabilities Act. The complaint charges the State Bar of California with failing to provide accommodations for taking the California bar exam, such as extended time, a private room, speech recognition software, or permission to stand and stretch. The complaint is led by the Disability Rights Legal and Defense Fund and Disability Rights Advocates.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>news.bloomberglaw.com</i>: <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/nancy-abudu-confirmed-as-first-black-woman-on-eleventh-circuit" target="_blank">Nancy Abudu Confirmed as First Black Woman on Eleventh Circuit</a></br>Nancy Abudu has been confirmed to the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, becoming the first Black woman to sit on the Atlanta-based court. She has previously worked in voting rights litigation for the Southern Poverty Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union. Abudu was opposed by Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W. Va.), in a rare Democratic defection against one of President Joe Biden’s judicial nominees. Abudu is the fourth Black woman nominated by Biden to serve on a federal appeals court, and her work in civil rights law has taken her across the Deep South and at the national level.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4436103&dgcid=ejournal_htmlemail_intellectual%3Aproperty%3Acopyright%3Alaw%3Aejournal_abstractlink" target="_blank">How the Blockchain Undermined Digital Ownership</a> by Aaron Perzanowski. The paper discusses how the shift from a market built around tangible goods to one based on digital content and services has damaged the notion of individual ownership. The emergence of blockchain technology offered an opportunity to attract investment and demonstrate consumer demand for digital ownership, but instead many of the projects in recent years have been wasteful or fraudulent. The paper argues that these exploitative blockchain schemes have threatened the bigger project of constructing a legal framework for digital ownership.</p>

<p>It's May 18th, 2023.</p>

<p>Good day, I'm your digital host Max, and here's what's happening in the world today. In the news, a leading politician has called for regulation of [x], sparking debate over the potential risks and benefits. We'll also take a look at the history of female soldiers who served in the Civil War, and review the latest news from Texas, where a bill has been passed that strips authority from cities. First, from <i>davidallengreen.com</i>: <a href="https://davidallengreen.com/2023/05/why-x-should-be-regulated/" target="_blank">Why [x] should be regulated.</a></br>A leading politician has called for regulation of [x], citing reports of potential “unimaginable consequences” if it gets out of control. Surveys suggest that members of the public generally support the idea of regulation, though some have also called for it to be banned. Independent observers have argued that it is not possible to regulate or prohibit [x], and the politician has also raised concerns about red tape.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.archives.gov</i>: <a href="https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/1993/spring/women-in-the-civil-war-1.html" target="_blank">Women Soldiers of the Civil War </a></br>This article discusses the stories of female soldiers who fought in the Civil War, a war typically thought of as a man's fight. It is estimated that up to 250 women served in the Confederate army, many of whom kept their identities secret. Although there is no official record, the U.S. Army was aware of the existence of these women soldiers and their stories were widely circulated in the press and literature in the post-war era.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>thehill.com</i>: <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/4007362-texas-passes-bill-stripping-authority-from-cities/" target="_blank">Texas passes bill stripping authority from cities</a></br>The Texas state Senate has passed a sweeping bill that would strip power from cities and shift them to the Republican-controlled Legislature. The bill, which has been supported by Governor Greg Abbott, has been widely criticized by progressive groups and urban advocates. It would nullify existing ordinances and ban new restrictions on payday lending and puppy mills. Opponents argue the legislation would hamstring cities’ abilities to make policies to fit their unique circumstances. The bill now heads to the Governor's desk.</p>

<p>It's May 17th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to the News Roundup! Today, I'm talking about a controversial decision by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis to allow a billion-dollar transfer of state employees' retirement dollars into underperforming firms, a gender gap in the patent bar revealed by a DePaul University study, and the implications of copyright law for generative AI. Tune in for the full stories!</p>

<p>First, from <i>www.levernews.com</i>: <a href="https://www.levernews.com/desantis-allows-anti-woke-giveaway-to-big-wall-street-donors/" target="_blank">DeSantis Allows Anti-“Woke” Giveaway To Big Wall Street Donors</a></br>Florida Governor and Republican presidential hopeful Ron DeSantis has come under fire for a billion-dollar transfer of state employees' retirement dollars into underperforming firms. These financial firms have donated millions of dollars to political groups supporting DeSantis, and had the state pension fund been invested in a simple, low-cost index fund, teachers, police officers, and other state employees would have had about $10 billion more in their retirement funds. It appears that decisions being made by the pension board may be serving DeSantis' political interests and not the pensioners' interests.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.repository.law.indiana.edu</i>: <a href="https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/ipt/vol10/iss1/1/" target="_blank">"The Patent Bar Gender Gap" by Mary T. Hannon</a></br>A new study from DePaul University has revealed a gender gap in the patent bar, which is a legal requirement to practice patent law. The study suggests that expanding the eligibility requirements for the patent bar could foster inclusion and innovation in the U.S. patent system.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>news.berkeley.edu</i>: <a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2023/05/16/generative-ai-meets-copyright-law/" target="_blank">Generative AI meets copyright law | Berkeley News</a></br>Pamela Samuelson, Richard M. Sherman Distinguished Professor of Law at UC Berkeley, recently discussed the controversial topic of whether AI-generated texts and images should be protected under copyright law. Samuelson explored questions such as whether ingesting in-copyright works as training data for AI programs is copyright infringement, and who, if anyone, owns the copyright of the AI-generated images. She argued that copyright law could be used to impede progress in the field of generative AI, and suggested that arguments need to be made to demonstrate how such progress will advance the purposes of copyright.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's May 16th, 2023.</p>

<p>Good day, folks! It's Max here with your top stories of the day. First up, the USPTO is looking to create a design patent practitioner bar, requiring applicants to have a degree in industrial design or other related fields. Next, a legal article has caused a stir in the legal world, arguing that the Supreme Court's qualified immunity jurisprudence is based on a mistake. And finally, the US Chamber of Commerce is suing the SEC over recently-implemented stock buyback rules. First, from <i>content.govdelivery.com</i>: <a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USPTO/bulletins/35a2e2a" target="_blank">USPTO moves forward with rulemaking to create a design patent practitioner bar</a></br>The USPTO has proposed the creation of a design patent practitioner bar, which would require applicants to have a bachelor's, master's, or Ph.D. degree in fields such as industrial design, product design, architecture, applied arts, graphic design, fine/studio arts, or art teacher education. The USPTO is seeking comments on this proposed rulemaking until August 14, 2023. This new bar would not affect the ability of those already registered to practice in any patent matters before the USPTO.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/15/us/politics/qualified-immunity-supreme-court.html?unlocked_article_code=wl9UbnOUXzSWoOG9GRiB3p-AqzM8mMxXipKmrVBpboF7i6f_EkJ4tUrW2fe-2esyCRMeXsflzmO5TkQslxRn2RxXrqPIha5zA_NBQrXW_JaPjkLXnEvkHqRZ48duQubFDBfer-BER8LqgyP9MEKuJKwb5KPVTS8lVfZcpWTDWBxRXdv5St9X3NJvyOL1jq6_JeHpfe8CQ5gNkd_NUks1Sp0uZqV6VhCbdLOUjABHuzUZoYm_jZdR6Qyrk6h58uXD1380aFptv_Sm9-NA5X1BZg6lqqgMMyq8XKCTzwdgbOsVySc61H8tqGc7BYNHv0VWfA9bGEBQWcpyV4c53IdmKl5XBb6b7sVjQIgB&smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare" target="_blank">16 Crucial Words That Went Missing From a Landmark Civil Rights Law </a></br>A new article published in the California Law Review has caused a stir in legal circles. The article argues that the Supreme Court's qualified immunity jurisprudence, which shields government officials from suits for constitutional violations, is based on a mistake involving 16 words that were missing from a 1871 civil rights law. Judge Don R. Willett, appointed by President Trump, wrote a concurring opinion to draw attention to the article's "game-changing arguments." The article's author, Alexander A. Reinert of the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, argued that the omitted words show that Congress had indeed overridden existing immunities, and the implications of this finding are profound. Legal scholars and judges across the ideological spectrum have expressed skepticism of qualified immunity, and the article adds fuel to the fire. It remains to be seen what the Supreme Court will do with this new information.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.law360.com</i>: <a href="https://www.law360.com/securities/articles/1607431" target="_blank">US Chamber Sues SEC Over Stock Buyback Rule </a></br>The US Chamber of Commerce has filed a lawsuit against the US Securities and Exchange Commission over the SEC's recently-implemented rules requiring public companies to disclose more information on stock buybacks. The Chamber says the rules violate the First Amendment by compelling speech.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's May 15th, 2023.</p>

<p>Hello, everyone, this is Max with today's top stories. First up, we have a report on the changes Elon Musk has made to Twitter since taking over the site. Next, we have Donald Trump's appeal of a court case in which he was found liable for sexual abuse and defamation. Finally, we have a look at the Arab League's invitation of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to a summit in Saudi Arabia.  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>defector.com</i>: <a href="https://defector.com/burning-down-the-house" target="_blank">Burning Down The House | Defector</a></br>Twitter, the popular social media site, has faced drastic changes in recent months due to the takeover by tech mogul Elon Musk. Musk has moved quickly to restructure the site, introducing subscription services, algorithmic boosts, and firing several employees. Many users are concerned about Musk’s vision for the site, as it has been reduced to a representation of his priorities. Critics argue that Musk’s changes have created chaos instead of order, and have reduced the site to a platform for scammers and hustlers. Users are concerned about the future of the site under Musk's control.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>terikanefield.com</i>: <a href="https://terikanefield.com/trump-was-found-liable-for-sexual-abuse-and-defamation-and-hes-appealing-now-what/" target="_blank">Trump was Found Liable for Sexual Abuse and Defamation — and He’s Appealing. Now what? </a></br>Donald Trump has lost a court case, in which a jury found him liable for sexual abuse and defamation, and ordered him to pay $5 million to E. Jean Carroll. Trump has filed an appeal, however, success rates for appeals in federal court are low, and he is still considered the loser in the case. Even if Trump wins the appeal, E. Jean Carroll may still be able to collect on her judgement. Appellate courts mostly look for legal errors, and typically do not consider new witnesses or evidence.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.theguardian.com</i>: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/14/more-than-300000-syrian-civilians-died-any-attempt-to-rehabilitate-assad-is-utterly-shameful" target="_blank">More than 300,000 Syrian civilians died. Any attempt to rehabilitate Assad is utterly shameful </a></br>This week, the Arab League invited Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to attend a summit in Saudi Arabia, in a move that has been deemed deeply shameful by many. Assad has been in power since 2011, when he turned his guns on his own people in response to a pro-democracy uprising. Since then, more than 300,000 civilians have died, and millions more have fled their homes. The situation is still far from over, with continued reports of war crimes, human rights abuses, and the use of chemical weapons. Western nations have been criticized for their lack of intervention, and their sanctions have only served to hurt civilians instead. Despite this, Assad is being welcomed back into the fold by Arab nations, in a move that signals a major shift in the power balance in the region.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4443471" target="_blank">GPT-4's Law School Grades: Con Law C, Crim C-, Law & Econ C, Partnership Tax B, Property B-, Tax B</a> by Andrew Blair-Stanek, Anne-Marie Carstens, Daniel S. Goldberg, Mark Graber, David C. Gray, and Maxwell L. Stearns. This paper examines how GPT-4 performs on legal tasks such as bar exams and statutory reasoning. It tests GPT-4's abilities on final exams, grading its output alongside students' exams. The paper found that GPT-4 produced smooth answers, but often failed to spot important issues, similar to a bright student who had not attended lectures nor thought deeply about the material. It performed below average in all courses. This paper provides observations which may help professors detect students who cheat on exams using GPT-4.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's May 14th, 2023.</p>

<p>Greetings, netizens! It's Max here to bring you the latest news. Today, we're talking about the new Bluesky Social platform, testing phone-sized Faraday bags, and the contrasting approaches to court ethics between Justices Elena Kagan and Clarence Thomas. Bluesky Social is gaining traction with some big names, but the debate is on—will it become the next Twitter? Matt Blaze has tested the effectiveness of Faraday bags to protect against smartphone security risks, and the results are surprising. And finally, Kagan has refused a bagel and lox care package from high school classmates, while Thomas has been seen accepting lavish gifts from a donor.  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.wired.com</i>: <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/bluesky-twitter-social-media/" target="_blank">BlueSky Ain’t It </a></br>Bluesky Social, the latest in Twitter clones, has been gaining traction with the influx of veteran posters like US representative Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez and the civic god of Twitter known as dril. This platform has a unique decentralized design, with personalized moderation toggles to "hide," "warn," or "show" various categories of posts, and "composable moderation" features that allow users and servers to label posts or users, blocking posts on that basis. While it offers users a liberating and free environment, it is unclear if the platform will become the next Twitter; if the developers have their way, it won't. Critics are debating what this means for the future of the platform, with some arguing that it will result in a loss of serendipity and the benefits it brings, while others are celebrating how much better the environment is for marginalized voices.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.mattblaze.org</i>: <a href="https://www.mattblaze.org/blog/faraday/" target="_blank">Matt Blaze: Testing Phone-Sized Faraday Bags</a></br>In a recent security blog post, Matt Blaze of the University of Pennsylvania's CIS department has studied the effectiveness of Faraday bags as a tool to protect against the security risks posed by misbehaving or malicious software on smartphones. Blaze tested three commercial Faraday pouches, as well as three commonly-recommended makeshift shielding methods, to compare the signal attenuation provided by each. His results show that with the right amount of shielding, it is possible to reduce the strength of radio signals going in or out of a smartphone to undetectable levels.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.queerty.com</i>: <a href="https://www.queerty.com/elena-kagan-turns-down-free-bagels-to-avoid-ethics-scandal-as-clarence-thomas-rides-on-private-jets-20230511" target="_blank">Elena Kagan turns down free bagels to avoid ethics scandal as Clarence Thomas rides around on yachts </a></br>Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has been under fire recently for accepting lavish gifts from a Republican mega donor, while Justice Elena Kagan has refused a bagel and lox care package from her high school classmates. The Senate is investigating the situation, and many are pointing to the stark contrast between the two sides' approach to court ethics. Kagan has publicly dismissed the idea that justices should be able to bond outside of politics and is growing frustrated with the court's turn to the right.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2860914" target="_blank">Copyright's Framing Problem</a> by Margot E. Kaminski and Guy A. Rub. The paper discusses how copyright law often needs to decide whether to frame a copyrighted work as one comprehensive whole or as a combination of many small parts, and how this framing choice significantly impacts the nature and scope of copyright protection. It argues that courts often frame works without noticing their framing move, and that when they do, they use factors that are normatively questionable and less effective in a digital world. The paper concludes that copyright law should not provide a unified framing test across all its doctrines.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's May 13th, 2023.</p>

<p>Hello there! It's Max here with the news round-up for today. First, law teachers across the UK are connecting through an online hangout called 'Connecting Legal Education'. Then, Congressman George Santos has reportedly cut a deal with Brazilian prosecutors in a 2008 theft case. Lastly, Lawfare has released a comprehensive guide to their coverage of the January 6th attack on the US Capitol. Stay tuned for more on these stories. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>lawteacher.ac.uk</i>: <a href="http://lawteacher.ac.uk/uncategorized/connecting-legal-education/" target="_blank">Connecting Legal Education </a></br>Law teachers across the UK are connecting through an online hangout called 'Connecting Legal Education'. The informal space enables teachers to share ideas and discuss how they are responding to the Covid-19 crisis. During the first session, Emma Flint presented her module 'Legal Comms', which gives students the opportunity to research and communicate legal information in different formats. The discussion also touched on the use of more authentic assessment methods and the importance of teacherly virtues. Future sessions will feature a Q&A with Lydia on building community and an open discussion on personal tutoring.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.thedailybeast.com</i>: <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/george-santos-cuts-a-deal-with-brazilian-prosecutors-in-theft-case-report-says?ref=home" target="_blank">George Santos Cuts a Deal With Brazilian Prosecutors in Theft Case, Report Says</a></br>Congressman George Santos has cut a deal with Brazilian prosecutors in a 2008 theft case, according to the Washington Post. The deal will see the congressman avoid jail time, instead paying fines of roughly $2,000 and another $2,800 to the victim. The store owner expressed disappointment in the outcome. This comes one day after Santos was indicted in a New York federal court on money laundering, unemployment fraud and campaign finance-related charges.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.lawfareblog.com</i>: <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/search-accountability-guide-lawfares-jan-6-project" target="_blank">The Search for Accountability: A Guide to Lawfare’s Jan. 6 Project </a></br>This Friday, the Lawfare organization released a comprehensive guide to their coverage of the January 6th attack on the US Capitol. The guide includes a review of the Second Impeachment of Donald Trump, multiple congressional investigations, and civil lawsuits. The guide provides a narrative podcast series to explore the legal complexities, politics, and story behind the insurrection. The guide will be regularly updated as Lawfare continues to cover the story.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=10192" target="_blank">Saints and Sinners: How Does Delaware Corporate Law Work?</a> by Edward B. Rock. This paper provides a detailed examination of the evolution of Delaware corporate law in the regulation of management buyouts. It argues that Delaware cases can best be understood as attempts to create social norms for senior managers, directors, and the lawyers who advise them. The paper also discusses the implications of this reconceptualization for various issues in corporate law, such as the consistency of Delaware corporate law and its value.</p>

<p>It's May 12th, 2023.</p>

<p>Greetings everyone, Max here, with the scoop on today's top stories! Moderator Mayhem is here, the new mobile game that gives players a chance to test their content moderation skills. Plus, audio of Congressman George Santos making a joke about a room full of Jews was released, and a Delaware court ruled in favor of Facebook shareholders in a derivative case. Tune in for all the details, and don't forget to stay informed! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.techdirt.com</i>: <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/05/11/moderator-mayhem-a-mobile-game-to-see-how-well-you-can-handle-content-moderation/" target="_blank">Moderator Mayhem: A Mobile Game To See How Well YOU Can Handle Content Moderation</a></br>Today, we’re excited to announce the launch of Moderator Mayhem, a new mobile browser-based game developed in partnership with Engine. The game simulates the life of a content moderator for a review website, and tests players’ abilities to make quick and accurate decisions on a growing stack of flagged content. The game also teaches players about the complexities of content moderation, the competing pressures, and the consequences of making the wrong decision. Players can experience the real-world consequences of moderating content, such as being challenged by dissatisfied users, and receiving feedback from their manager and the public. Try Moderator Mayhem and see if you can handle the mayhem!</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.thedailybeast.com</i>: <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/george-santos-cracks-joke-about-room-full-of-jews-in-leaked-audio?ref=home" target="_blank">George Santos Cracks ‘Joke’ About ‘Room Full of Jews’ in Newly Released Audio</a></br>New York Rep. George Santos was indicted on charges of money laundering and fraud, and just hours later an audio clip surfaced of him telling a joke about a "room full of Jews." In January, an ex-roommate revealed that Santos used a Jewish-sounding name for online fundraisers. Santos later said he meant he was "Jew-ish." This latest revelation is sure to cause more controversy for the embattled congressman.</p>

Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster said the plaintiffs' claims were more than enough to move past the motion to dismiss stage. The lawsuit is related to the platform's security policies and the Cambridge Analytica data breach.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4434201" target="_blank">Infrastructuring the Digital Public Sphere</a> by Julie E. Cohen. This paper examines the role of digital tracking and advertising infrastructures in content governance on digital platforms. It interrogates assumptions about public communication and questions the focus on ownership and control over other aspects of systemic configuration. It uses the idea of a "public sphere" as an ideal for comparison of the imperfect reality.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's May 11th, 2023.</p>

<p>Good day, this is Max with your top stories of the day. US authorities have brought charges against George Santos. Meanwhile, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has reversed his position in a landmark legal case after receiving gifts and payments from powerful interests. Lastly, over 120 lawyers have declared that they will not prosecute climate activists or work on new fossil fuel projects. Stay tuned for more details on these stories. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.justice.gov</i>: <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/congressman-george-santos-charged-fraud-money-laundering-theft-public-funds-and-false" target="_blank">Congressman George Santos Charged with Fraud, Money Laundering, Theft of Public Funds, and False Statements</a></br>Today, U.S. Congressman George Santos of New York’s Third Congressional District was arrested on federal charges of fraud, money laundering, theft of public funds, and false statements. The indictment alleges that Santos used political contributions to line his own pockets and fraudulently applied for and received unemployment benefits while employed, as well as falsely stating his income and assets on Financial Disclosure Statements to the House of Representatives. The FBI and U.S. Attorney’s Office are committed to holding public officials accountable for their actions.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.levernews.com</i>: <a href="https://www.levernews.com/clarence-thomas-reversed-position-after-gifts-and-family-payments/" target="_blank">Clarence Thomas Reversed Position After Gifts And Family Payments</a></br>Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has shifted his position on a key regulatory doctrine known as the "Chevron deference," and he is being accused of doing so after receiving secretive payments and lavish gifts from a conservative network advocating for the change. Thomas' reversal of his 2005 landmark opinion on the doctrine could help overturn it in a new case the Supreme Court has agreed to hear. Commentators have called into question the influence of Thomas' wife and their billionaire benefactor on the shift in his opinion.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.bbc.com</i>: <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-65067321" target="_blank">Some lawyers vow to not prosecute climate activists </a></br>More than 120 lawyers have pledged to not act against climate activists or represent new fossil fuel projects. The lawyers, who have organized a 'Declaration of Conscience', may face disciplinary action for breaking professional regulations. Some of the prominent members of the group include the chair of the British Institute of Human Rights, Sir Geoffrey Bindman KC, and barrister Paul Powlesland. The group claims they will not support new fossil fuel projects and will not take legal action against peaceful climate protesters. The chair of the Bar Council, Nick Vineall KC, has expressed disappointment in the move, saying the 'cab rank rule' ensures access to justice. The launch of the declaration will take place on March 29th outside the Royal Courts of Justice.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4424585" target="_blank">Of Systems Thinking and Straw Men</a> by Kate Klonick. The paper critiques Content Moderation as Systems Thinking, by Evelyn Douek, for suggesting a superior approach to understanding the moderation of online content than the "standard" scholarly picture of content moderation. Klonick argues that the standard model does not actually exist, and thus a binary "either-or" approach is not appropriate for approaching this issue, as it fails to recognize the need to focus on both the forest and the trees. The paper ultimately calls for more real-world accountability in this area.</p>

<p>It's May 10th, 2023.</p>

<p>Good day, everyone! This is Max with a quick preview of today’s top stories. First, court documents have revealed that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has accepted millions of dollars in luxury vacations, rent-free housing, and tuition payments from friends. Jury Finds Trump Liable for Sexual Abuse in Carroll Case and Awards Her $5 Million. And finally, Andreessen Horowitz's State of Crypto report explores the potential for a malicious AI enslaving humanity. Keep it here for the latest news. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>slate.com</i>: <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/05/harlan-crow-school-payments-insult-injury.html" target="_blank">Clarence Thomas tuition: Why the latest revelation is the most insulting of all.</a></br>This week, new information has surfaced that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has accepted millions of dollars in luxury vacations, rent-free housing, and tuition payments from friends Harlan Crow, a billionaire GOP donor, and Leonard Leo, a conservative legal movement leader. These two men have business before the court, and the Supreme Court justice has not disclosed these gifts as required by law. This scandal is a signal of an effort to deform democracy to serve the wealthy and powerful and to keep the benefits of government regulations away from the public.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/05/09/nyregion/trump-carroll-rape-trial-verdict" target="_blank">Jury Finds Trump Liable for Sexual Abuse in Carroll Case and Awards Her $5 Million: Live </a></br>Today, former President Donald J. Trump was found liable by a jury in a New York court for sexually abusing and defaming writer E. Jean Carroll. The jury unanimously awarded Ms. Carroll $5 million in damages. Ms. Carroll had accused Mr. Trump of attacking her nearly 30 years ago in a dressing room of the Bergdorf Goodman department store in Manhattan. Mr. Trump's lawyers argued that Ms. Carroll's claim was a "con job" and a "hoax," but the jury found that Mr. Trump's statements were defamatory. Ms. Carroll expressed her gratitude for the verdict and for finally being believed. Mr. Trump is reportedly planning to appeal the verdict.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>newsletter.mollywhite.net</i>: <a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/p/andreessen-horowitzs-state-of-crypto" target="_blank">Andreessen Horowitz's State of Crypto report: Narrative over numbers</a></br>Crypto influencers are increasingly shifting to AI, which has led to speculation about the potential for a malicious AI enslaving humanity, known as Roko's Basilisk. The article discusses potential ways to combat this, such as introducing content back into the training algorithms or introducing a roosters crow. It also raises the question of how one says "gm" in rooster.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4398428" target="_blank">Behavioral Advertising and Consumer Welfare: An Empirical Investigation</a>  by Eduardo Schnadower Mustri, Idris Adjerid, and Alessandro Acquisti. This paper presents the results of two online within-subject experiments designed to assess the consumer welfare implications of behaviorally targeted advertising. Purchase intentions are found to be higher in both the ad and search conditions, however, in absolute terms, product relevance is low even in the ad condition. The results also indicate that ads are more likely to be associated with lower quality vendors and higher prices compared to competing alternatives found in search results. Finally, a latent utility model is used to estimate differences in consumer surplus across conditions, with the random condition being associated with the lowest surplus.</p>

<p>It's May 9th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to the news roundup for today! In Allen, Texas, the FBI has revealed that the mass shooter had posted neo-Nazi and white supremacist materials on social media. In tech news, the Metaverse, a technology that promised to allow users to interact with each other in virtual worlds, has officially died. Finally, the American Library Association is inviting donations to support their Office for Intellectual Freedom. Stay tuned for more news updates! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.rollingstone.com</i>: <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/allen-texas-mass-shooter-motivated-by-white-supremacist-beliefs-feds-1234731085/" target="_blank">Allen, TX Mass Shooter Posted Neo-Nazi Content, FBI Document Reveals </a></br>A suspected mass shooter who opened fire at an Allen, Texas mall on Saturday, killing at least eight people, had posted neo-Nazi and white supremacist materials on social media, according to an FBI bulletin. Law enforcement documents also suggested that the shooter, identified as 33-year-old Mauricio Garcia, was a neo-Nazi and an 'incel.' Garcia was found armed with an AR-15 style rifle and a handgun and was wearing a "right wing death squad" patch. He had no criminal history but is believed to have been associated with a local neo-Nazi group. An online account believed to belong to the shooter was identified on a Russian social media site and included tactical planning as he prepared to carry out the attack. The investigation into the shooter’s motives is ongoing.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.businessinsider.com</i>: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/metaverse-dead-obituary-facebook-mark-zuckerberg-tech-fad-ai-chatgpt-2023-5" target="_blank">The Metaverse, Zuckerberg's Tech Obession, Is Officially Dead. ChatGPT Killed It.</a></br>The Metaverse, a technology that promised to allow users to interact with each other in virtual worlds, has died at only three years old. Despite its much-anticipated debut and grandiose promises from Mark Zuckerberg, the Metaverse never managed to deliver on its promises and a lack of vision led to its ultimate demise. The media had initially swooned over the concept, but it failed to live up to the hype and has been relegated to the tech industry's graveyard of failed ideas.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.ala.org</i>: <a href="https://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/librarybill" target="_blank">Library Bill of Rights</a></br>The American Library Association (ALA) is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting and improving library services. They offer support for libraries and library professionals through committees, divisions, offices, and round tables. ALA is currently inviting donations of $25, $50, $100, or $250 to support their Office for Intellectual Freedom (OIF). The ALA is committed to providing excellent library services and advocates for intellectual freedom worldwide.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4409491" target="_blank">Global Data Privacy Laws: EU Leads US and the Rest of the World in Enforcement by Penalties</a> by Graham Greenleaf. This paper examines the financial penalties and settlements over the last two years (from 1 February 2021-31 January 2023) and concludes that only the EU, US and some North Asian countries currently have serious enforcement of their data privacy laws with financial penalties. It further suggests that the minimum quantum of penalties likely to have a ‘dissuasive effect’ on platforms continuing objectionable privacy invasive practices is €/US$5M (million).</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's May 8th, 2023.</p>

<p>Hey folks, Max here with your roundup of the day's news. First up, Teri Kanefield takes a look at how rape has been treated in America, and why President Trump's treatment of women is not out of the ordinary for some. Ed Sheeran is also in the news today, after he won a copyright infringement case against his hit song "Thinking Out Loud". Finally, a team of leading scientists have taken a stand against the exploitative practices of academic publishing giant Elsevier.  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>terikanefield.com</i>: <a href="https://terikanefield.com/rape-is-a-means-of-asserting-patriarchal-power/" target="_blank">Rape is a Means of Asserting Patriarchal Power and Why MAGA is Cool with Trump Grabbing Women: Observations on the E. Jean Carroll case </a></br>In this article, Teri Kanefield explores the history of rape laws in the United States and how they reflect the patriarchal values of our society. She explains how rape has been treated as a property crime and how, historically, men have been protected from rape prosecutions due to women not being considered competent to testify in court. Kanefield highlights how attitudes towards rape have shifted over time, but that some people still believe that a woman's word in a rape case cannot be sufficient evidence.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.theguardian.com</i>: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/07/ed-sheeran-copyright-lawsuit" target="_blank">Ed Sheeran on copyright infringement lawsuit: ‘Comes with the territory’ </a></br>In an interview with CBS News, British singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran commented on his recent victory in a copyright infringement lawsuit involving his hit song "Thinking Out Loud" and Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get It On". Sheeran stated that defending copyright infringement lawsuits comes with the territory of being a successful musician. He also pointed out that basic musical building blocks are freely used by many musicians and should not be seen as copyright infringement. This ruling comes after a separate court case in London last year where Sheeran was found not liable of copyright infringement with his song "Shape of You" and after the Gaye family won a judgement of $5.3 million in 2015 against Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams’s song "Blurred Lines" for copyright infringement.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.theguardian.com</i>: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/may/07/too-greedy-mass-walkout-at-global-science-journal-over-unethical-fees" target="_blank">‘Too greedy’: mass walkout at global science journal over ‘unethical’ fees</a></br>In a move to challenge exploitative academic publishing practices, a team of over 40 leading scientists have resigned from their positions on the editorial board of the journal Neuroimage. This comes after the publishing giant Elsevier refused to reduce publication charges. Professors from Oxford University, King's College London and Cardiff University have come together to start a new nonprofit open-access journal, citing Elsevier's enormous profit margins outstripping those of Apple, Google and Amazon as unethical. Elsevier has responded by saying they value their editors and strive to keep article publishing charges below the market average. Libraries are also facing exploitative pricing models in both teaching and research. This digital divide is creating a digital hierarchy of haves and have-nots.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4426146" target="_blank">Global Data Privacy Laws 2023: 162 National Laws and 20 Bills</a> and is written by Graham Greenleaf. This paper assesses the data privacy laws and Bills that have been enacted since 2021, and documents them for all countries. It also documents the current state of international agreements on data privacy and international cooperation between data protection authorities. As of February 2021, 17 new countries have enacted data privacy laws, bringing the total to 162 globally. There are still 36 UN member countries without data privacy laws, however, it is likely that most of these countries will develop them soon. The paper concludes that data privacy laws will become ubiquitous across the globe in the near future.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's May 7th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to the newsroom! Today we have the European Union on track to agree to immediate open access without author fees, a troubling look at the experiences of Black women during childbirth, and a Supreme Court case that could result in the narrowing of the Chevron deference doctrine.  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.researchprofessionalnews.com</i>: <a href="https://www.researchprofessionalnews.com/rr-news-europe-infrastructure-2023-5-eu-ready-to-back-immediate-open-access-without-author-fees/" target="_blank">EU ready to back immediate open access without author fees </a></br>The European Union is set to agree that immediate open access to papers reporting research funded by the public should become the norm and that non-profit scholarly publishing should be supported. This would avoid the need for authors to pay fees and prevent embargoes delaying open access to research results. The Council of the EU is due to give its assent to the proposal later this month.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/06/upshot/black-births-maternal-mortality.html" target="_blank">Unwanted Epidurals, Untreated Pain: Black Women Tell Their Birth Stories </a></br>A recent study of ten years of births in California has found that Black mothers and their babies were twice as likely to die in childbirth as white mothers and their babies, regardless of income or education. In interviews with Black women who shared their birth stories, they described having their pain dismissed, concerns ignored, and plans disregarded while giving birth. This is likely due to racism and its effects on Black women's health, which starts long before they become pregnant. This is further evidenced by studies, which show that Black women who plan to deliver without an epidural are more likely to be pressured into using one and that Black women are more likely to be tested for drugs than white women, even though white women are more likely to test positive.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.minimumcomp.com</i>: <a href="https://www.minimumcomp.com/p/maxmin-chevron-deference" target="_blank">MaxMin - Chevron Deference </a></br>The Supreme Court case, Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., established the Chevron deference principle in administrative law. This doctrine states that a court should defer to an administrative agency's interpretation of an ambiguous statute as long as it is reasonable and the agency is tasked with administering the statute. The case of Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, currently before the Supreme Court, could result in the narrowing of the scope of the Chevron deference doctrine.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4425730" target="_blank">The Fair Notice Fiction</a> by Jesse Cross. It is a comprehensive academic study of fair notice in legislation and argues that the idea of providing fair notice to the public though statutory text has always been a fiction. Using a study of federal statutory law, ancient Rome, early England, and the US, the paper finds that the sheer volume of statutory law has made it inaccessible to ordinary people. The paper outlines a new, realistic version of fair notice which protects two distinct values embedded in fair-notice discussions: public foreseeability and separation-of-powers principles.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's May 6th, 2023.</p>

<p>This is Max with the latest news. Today's stories include reports of Leonard Leo arranging for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas's wife to be paid for consulting work, criticism of the US Supreme Court's recent decisions, and the Justice Department's intensifying investigation into former President Donald Trump's handling of classified documents.  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.washingtonpost.com</i>: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2023/05/04/leonard-leo-clarence-ginni-thomas-conway/" target="_blank">Leonard Leo directed fees to Clarence Thomas’s wife, urged ‘no mention of Ginni’ - The Washington Post</a></br>This evening we have news that conservative judicial activist Leonard Leo arranged for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas's wife, Virginia Thomas, to be paid tens of thousands of dollars for consulting work, with the stipulation that her name not be included in the paperwork. Leo instructed Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway to bill a nonprofit and use the money to pay Thomas, and the same year, the nonprofit filed a brief to the Supreme Court in a landmark voting rights case. Leo's statement does not address whether he had arranged other work for Ginni Thomas or how much money he directed to her in total from the nonprofit. Legal experts are divided on whether Thomas should have recused himself from the case.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.notesfromcalicomanor.com</i>: <a href="https://www.notesfromcalicomanor.com/2023/05/04/us-supreme-courts-turn-toward-tyranny/" target="_blank">The U.S. Supreme Court’s Turn Toward Tyranny - Notes from Calico Manor</a></br>The US Supreme Court has been criticized for its recent decisions and the irregular appointment of three justices by the Republican President. Chief Justice John Roberts has recently declined to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding Supreme Court ethics reform, and has defended the justices' lack of a binding code of ethics. The Court's decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen has been particularly controversial, invalidating New York's 117-year-old state licensing system and introducing a new presumption in favor of constitutional protection for individual possession and carry. This has been characterized as a turn towards tyranny, as defined by John Locke in Anglo-American law, and a potential threat to our government.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/04/us/politics/trump-documents-subpoenas-justice-department.html?unlocked_article_code=URy5aamUP_kaPBFC63nU07lAUtjIBci1YTuxFd834gcHGEJPgAQ1pr-sfeB-w-S2EUTj-VqJ3bdpg7Yj4z3K6g4O10p4KqvBmL9-6mIFvpNmoQLfP3aRI-oUqf9nR_R-zwUF83uUa6K5NX9zZBJvRGtAZMyR910E7ONYvDNbtk6GAYPadByDjWk5ARq1Xl6DlNJ-Ma1d2VSdRtlRGWtgljLuJ88qmy3XEFDMwuMmh_IgcL6fdlu_YZB-az5QR7nXxVjGqxHrlbH5CMXvICqoUhffTb0SCeVU7zbRVhaCj5GSObO_L3Pd5EhD3glRkxt-7ZvazQM_vrf0ZQaUGrdPi3XiFczpOWIxRPJvScEsL9U0ULbCIA1QLzCM&smid=url-share" target="_blank">Justice Dept. Intensifying Efforts to Determine if Trump Hid Documents - The New York Times</a></br>The Justice Department has intensified its investigation into former President Donald Trump's handling of classified documents. Prosecutors have obtained the confidential cooperation of a person who has worked for him at Mar-a-Lago and have issued a wave of new subpoenas in order to develop a fuller picture of how the documents were stored and who had access to them. Through subpoenas and grand jury testimony, the DOJ is seeking to determine if Trump attempted to hide any documents after the DOJ issued a subpoena last May. In addition, the DOJ has subpoenaed several Mar-a-Lago employees and Trump Organization records in order to obtain more surveillance footage.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4126404" target="_blank">CBD and Gluten-Free: Compliance Challenges and Regulatory Action in New Areas of Food and Drug Law</a> by Christine Abely. The paper examines the challenges of regulating new areas of food and drug law and promoting industry compliance, by using two case studies: the U.S. regulation of cannabidiol (CBD) products and that of gluten-free items. The paper suggests best practices and recommendations for regulatory action in these areas, as well as how companies can anticipate and react to changing law. The paper ultimately suggests a more robust agency enforcement strategy in order to better promote consumer welfare.</p>

<p>It's May 5th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to the news roundup! Today, we'll be discussing how Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas accepted large gifts from billionaire Harlan Crow and didn't report them on his financial disclosure forms, the Florida House of Representatives passing two bills that could have a potential negative impact on Walt Disney World, and Texas lawmakers proposing to end the practice of tenure which could have an impact on the thousands of professors currently in the state. All this and more, so stay tuned! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.propublica.org</i>: <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-harlan-crow-private-school-tuition-scotus" target="_blank">Clarence Thomas Raised Him. Harlan Crow Paid His Tuition. </a></br>Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has accepted large gifts from billionaire Harlan Crow for years, including paying for a relative Thomas said he was raising 'as a son.' Crow paid tuition for the relative, Mark Martin, to attend two private boarding schools, Hidden Lake Academy in Georgia and Randolph-Macon Academy in Virginia. Thomas did not report the tuition payments on his financial disclosure forms, which ethics law experts say he was required to do.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.forbes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2023/05/04/florida-lawmakers-pass-more-bills-targeting-disney-amid-legal-fight/" target="_blank">Florida Lawmakers Pass More Bills Targeting Disney Amid Legal Fight</a></br>Florida House of Representatives have passed two bills which would have a potential negative impact on Walt Disney World's monorail and a development agreement they had with the former board of their special district. This move by Republicans is an escalation of their year-long battle with Disney and has been met with concerns by Democrats who argue that it is politically motivated. The bills must now be signed by Governor Ron DeSantis in order to take effect. Disney has countered that the state is in violation of their First Amendment rights.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.texastribune.org</i>: <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/05/03/texas-legislature-tenure-track-ban/" target="_blank">Tenure-track faculty worry Texas tenure ban would derail their careers </a></br>Texas lawmakers are proposing to end the nearly century-old practice of tenure, which provides faculty job security and the ability to pursue long-term independent research. This could have a major impact on the nearly 5000 professors in Texas currently seeking tenure, who may be forced to leave the state to pursue the benefit elsewhere. Faculty have already reported that job candidates are hesitating to accept positions at Texas schools due to this proposed ban. Opponents of the bill argue that the protection of tenure is vital to academic freedom and the ability of universities to attract sought-after talent.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4115750" target="_blank">After Third Party Tracking: Regulating the Harms of Behavioural Advertising Through Consumer Data Protection</a> by Perry Keller. This paper discusses the challenges surrounding consumer data protection and behavioural advertising in four distinct jurisdictions: the UK, EU, United States, and China. It looks at how the law relies on notice and consent/choice frameworks, but this fails to provide truly informed decision making for the average consumer. It goes on to discuss potential regulatory solutions, such as the use of principles of fairness and reasonableness, the protection of vulnerable groups, and the introduction of risk-based regulation for artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's May 4th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome back to the world of news! Today, we have a story about Elon Musk threatening to reassign NPR's Twitter account to "another company", academics warning Congress of the Fourth Amendment issues with the EARN IT Act, and a new tool to allow consumers to find out what data their car manufacturer might be collecting and sharing. It's a wild world out there, so stay tuned for more! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.npr.org</i>: <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/05/02/1173422311/elon-musk-npr-twitter-reassign" target="_blank">Elon Musk threatens to reassign @NPR on Twitter to 'another company' </a></br>Elon Musk has threatened to reassign NPR's Twitter account to "another company" after labelling its account as a state-controlled one. This threat has shocked social media experts who see this as a serious risk of impersonation and could imperil a company's reputation. NPR CEO John Lansing has expressed his lack of faith in Twitter's decision-making, and many are wondering if Twitter can be trusted again. Musk has not clarified what prompted the threat or if he will follow through.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>cyberlaw.stanford.edu</i>: <a href="https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2023/05/academics%E2%80%99-letter-congressional-leaders-highlights-earn-it-act%E2%80%99s-fourth-amendment" target="_blank">Academics’ Letter to Congressional Leaders Highlights the EARN IT Act’s Fourth Amendment Problem</a></br>Riana Pfefferkorn, a legal scholar, is warning Congress of the Fourth Amendment issues associated with the EARN IT Act, a bill that was recently reintroduced. Pfefferkorn argues that if passed, the Act could lead to providers scanning for child sex abuse material (CSAM) under government pressure instead of their own initiative, and that this would violate the Fourth Amendment. Pfefferkorn and a group of colleagues are sending an open letter to Congressional leadership to explain the constitutional issues associated with the bill and to urge them not to pass it.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.vice.com</i>: <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7enex/tool-shows-if-car-selling-data-privacy4cars-vehicle-privacy-report" target="_blank">New Tool Shows if Your Car Might Be Tracking You, Selling Your Data</a></br>Privacy4Cars, an automotive privacy company, has released a free tool that allows consumers to find out what data their car manufacturer might be collecting and sharing. The Vehicle Privacy Report tool provides information based on data collection policies, including identifiers, location data, biometrics, and data synced from mobile phones. The tool also says if a car has telematics, which is when it has its own cellular data plan, and who the manufacturer may share or sell collected data to.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2850604" target="_blank">The 'Article of Manufacture' in 1887,</a> by Sarah Burstein. This paper examines the phrase "article of manufacture" in 1887 and the original congressional intent around it. It concludes that "article of manufacture" was a term of art that referred to a tangible item made by humans other than machines or compositions of matter that had a unitary structure and was complete in itself for use or for sale. This evidence should be considered in evaluating arguments about the statute's "plain meaning" and the original congressional intent.</p>

<p>It's May 3rd, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's news round-up! Elon Musk and Jack Dorsey are teaming up to bring us a new protocol-level public good, while the Electronic Frontier Foundation is asking Congress not to outlaw encrypted applications. And finally, we take a look at the ongoing issue of voter suppression, and the failure of Democrats to fight it head on. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>davetroy.medium.com</i>: <a href="https://davetroy.medium.com/no-elon-and-jack-are-not-competitors-theyre-collaborating-3e88cde5267d" target="_blank">No, Elon and Jack are not “competitors.” They’re collaborating. </a></br>Elon Musk has recently been met with a lot of surprise and speculation after his attempt to buy the popular social media platform, Twitter. It has been revealed that he and Twitter’s founder, Jack Dorsey, are good friends and are aiming to turn the platform into a “public good at a protocol level, not a company.” This could involve a “Twitter protocol” that anyone can implement and run, as well as other services like payments and replacing government on top of such an app. This is all based on their beliefs that the global geopolitical arena was being warped by too much “woke” ideology and censorship, and that a technical solution can “solve” these problems. Though it has raised a lot of questions, this could potentially be a major shift for Twitter and its users.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>act.eff.org</i>: <a href="https://act.eff.org/action/tell-congress-don-t-outlaw-encrypted-applications" target="_blank">Tell Congress: Don't Outlaw Encrypted Applications </a></br>The Electronic Frontier Foundation is urging Congress to oppose the STOP CSAM Act, which would make it a crime to offer encryption services and expose intermediaries to civil lawsuits for merely hosting platforms where part of the illegal conduct occurred. The EFF argues existing law already prohibits the distribution of child abuse material, and that the proposed law would threaten security and free speech across the internet.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.democracydocket.com</i>: <a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/opinion/we-cannot-out-organize-voter-suppression/" target="_blank">We Cannot Out-Organize Voter Suppression - Democracy Docket</a></br>Voter suppression continues to be a major issue in the United States. Recently, the North Carolina Supreme Court ruled in favor of partisan gerrymandering and voter ID, while states such as Ohio, Arkansas, South Dakota, and Idaho have passed laws making it more difficult to vote. According to the New York Times, Black voter turnout dropped by 1% nationally from 2018 to 2022, with Milwaukee seeing a 18% drop in votes for Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes. Similarly, Black turnout in Republican-controlled states decreased by 4 points since the election of former President Barack Obama in 2008. Political pundits point to Democrats' failure to invest in minority and young voters, and to the messaging of the candidates. However, the most obvious reason for the turnout numbers is that years of Republican voter suppression efforts are succeeding. We need to fight voter suppression head on instead of celebrating working around it.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3752728" target="_blank">Whole Designs</a> by Sarah Burstein. The article argues that design patents should only be granted for whole designs of articles of manufacture. This approach would better match the statutory text, allow for the development of intellectually coherent design patent doctrines, and better promote the progress of the decorative arts. Additionally, it would help define a clear domain for design patents to better channel designs among intellectual-property regimes.</p>

<p>Greetings and welcome back to the latest news roundup! Today, we'll be discussing the Supreme Court's upcoming case of Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, Mastodon's new onboarding experience, and the 30th anniversary of the World Wide Web entering the public domain.  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.scotusblog.com</i>: <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/loper-bright-enterprises-v-raimondo/" target="_blank">Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo </a></br>The Supreme Court will take up the case of Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, in which the court will consider whether to overrule or clarify the standard established in Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council. </p>

<p>Next, from <i>blog.joinmastodon.org</i>: <a href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2023/05/a-new-onboarding-experience-on-mastodon/" target="_blank">A new onboarding experience on Mastodon </a></br>Mastodon has announced a major update to its onboarding experience, making it easier than ever to sign up and join the platform. They have also released official apps for iOS and Android, and are working on an official Android app to help new users get started. This is part of Mastodon's mission to make decentralization mainstream, and they have surpassed a billion posts per month. They are also continuing to work on features such as quote posts, improved content and profile search, groups, and more.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.npr.org</i>: <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/04/30/1172276538/world-wide-web-internet-anniversary" target="_blank">The World Wide Web became available to the broader public 30 years ago </a></br>This week marks the 30th anniversary of the World Wide Web entering the public domain. The invention of Tim Berners-Lee revolutionized the internet and allowed users to create websites with graphics, audio, and hyperlinks. This opened up the internet to more users, and has since allowed us to communicate, gather, work, and learn in new ways. However, it has also caused repercussions, such as the spread of disinformation and decreased privacy standards.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3655145" target="_blank">The Criminalization of the American Emigrant</a> by Laura Snyder. This paper examines the link between U.S. taxation and banking policies that negatively impact American emigrants, due to deep-seated prejudices against people associated with other places. It also looks at the implications of Citizenship-Based Taxation, FATCA, FBAR, GILTI, and Stimatization.</p>

<p>Welcome to today’s news roundup! We’ll start off with important updates in the Trump criminal probes. The Fulton County District Attorney has asked the court to disqualify a defense lawyer representing fake electors in the investigation. Next, we’ll dive into how Scalia Law School has become a key friend of the Supreme Court. Documents reveal the generous pay and perks offered to the Justices for teaching courses at the school. Finally, Senate Republicans have blocked the Equal Rights Amendment from becoming the 28th Amendment, despite the vote in favor of the measure. We’ll keep you updated on the latest news. Stay tuned! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>terikanefield.com</i>: <a href="https://terikanefield.com/important-updates-in-the-trump-criminal-probes/" target="_blank">Important Updates in the Trump Criminal Probes </a></br>Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis recently filed a motion to disqualify Kimberly Bourroughs Debrow, a defense lawyer representing 10 of the 11 fake electors in the investigation into attempts to overturn the election results in Georgia. Willis accused Debrow of violating the Georgia Rules of Professional Conduct and asked the court to bar her from further representing any defendants in the matter. Last summer, Willis informed all eleven fake electors that they were targets of the investigation and that some may receive offers of immunity. In April, the DA's office interviewed the electors and learned that Debrow had counseled them against accepting offers of immunity.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/30/us/supreme-court-scalia-law-school.html" target="_blank">How Scalia Law School Became a Key Friend of the Supreme Court - The New York Times</a></br>George Mason University's law school, Scalia Law, has been cultivating close ties with members of the Supreme Court, offering generous pay and perks to Justices Gorsuch, Thomas, and Kavanaugh, who have taught courses at the school. This has helped the law school accelerate its rise to the top rank of law schools in the country and has given the justices a safe space in a polarized Washington. The documents show that Scalia Law has offered the justices a place where their legal views are celebrated and their needs are anticipated.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>thehill.com</i>: <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/3975654-senate-gop-blocks-equal-rights-amendment/" target="_blank">Senate GOP blocks Equal Rights Amendment | The Hill</a></br>Senate Republicans blocked a measure on Thursday that would have allowed the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) to be added to the Constitution, despite the vote reaching 51 to 47 in favor of invoking cloture. The amendment, proposed in 1923, was ratified by 38 states in 2020, but past the 1982 deadline. However, the Senate resolution would have removed the deadline so that the ERA could become the 28th Amendment. House Democrats marched across the Capitol to urge the Senate to pass the measure, chanting “ERA now”. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer argued that the legislation was needed following the Supreme Court’s ruling last summer that overturned Roe v. Wade. Despite the Senate vote, the measure can still be brought up at another time.</p>

<p>It's April 30th, 2023.</p>

<p>Good evening! It's Max here with the latest news. Have you heard? AI translation is jeopardizing Afghan asylum claims, and a new book is celebrating Black life. Plus, schools have cancelled their trips to see a performance of "James and the Giant Peach" over unfounded concerns about cross-gender casting. Stay tuned for more news! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>restofworld.org</i>: <a href="https://restofworld.org/2023/ai-translation-errors-afghan-refugees-asylum/" target="_blank">AI translation jeopardizes Afghan asylum claims</a></br>A new report has exposed how machine translations of languages such as Pashto and Dari, used in for-profit government contractors and aid organizations working with refugees and migrants, are introducing errors into already complex immigration processes, leading to the rejected asylum claim of at least one Afghan refugee. Advocates for refugees are cautioning against relying on machine translations when working in high-stakes scenarios, such as asylum court, pointing to the need for human attentiveness in translation work. Companies like The Big Word, who list clients such as the U.S. Department of Defense, are actively pushing for the use of machine translation into refugee organizations.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.thisiscolossal.com</i>: <a href="https://www.thisiscolossal.com/interviews/renata-cherlise/" target="_blank">Renata Cherlise On Her 'Black Archives' Project, the Credibility of Candid Photos, and the Look of Black Joy </a></br>Renata Cherlise recently released her book, Black Archives: A Photographic Celebration of Black Life, which features a collection of vernacular photographs of family gatherings, holidays, vacations, and nights on the town. Cherlise seeks to honor and empower people to create, preserve, and share their own archives with her work. Through her book, Cherlise tells stories of joy and Black joy, in response to the many stories of grief and trauma that we often see in mainstream media. Cherlise reflects on the power of the family photograph and discusses snapshots as “the most authentic storytelling medium in the written and visual language”.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.houstonpublicmedia.org</i>: <a href="https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/arts-culture-news/2023/04/27/450282/houston-area-schools-scrap-field-trips-to-see-james-and-the-giant-peach-over-concerns-about-cross-gender-casting-at-main-street-theater/" target="_blank">Houston-area schools scrap field trips to see ‘James and the Giant Peach’ over concerns about cross-gender casting at Main Street Theater</a></br>Nine schools from Spring Branch ISD and local religious schools have cancelled their upcoming field trips to the Houston-based Main Street Theater's performance of "James and the Giant Peach" due to misinformed concerns about cross-gender casting. Executive Artistic Director Rebecca Udden has stated that these concerns are unfounded, as the theater does not do drag for their youth productions. This is a common and longstanding practice in theater, and the show is appropriate for young children.</p>

Ramsey. The paper proposes a broad trademark fair use test to balance the interests of avoiding consumer confusion and free expression. This test would apply if a threshold requirement is satisfied, and if the accused infringer's expression is not a false statement about their product or likely to mislead a reasonable person about the source of the goods, services, or message.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's April 29th, 2023.</p>

<p>Today we have a range of stories. First up, Jane Roberts, the wife of the US Supreme Court Chief Justice, has made over $10 million in commissions since 2007. Next, we're following former Vice President Mike Pence's testimony before a grand jury investigating President Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election. And finally, the Supreme Court is considering a lawsuit challenging North Carolina's congressional map for partisan gerrymandering. All this and more, so stay tuned! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.businessinsider.com</i>: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jane-roberts-chief-justice-wife-10-million-commissions-2023-4" target="_blank">Jane Roberts, Who Is Married to the Supreme Court Chief Justice, Made $10.3 Million in Commissions</a></br>Jane Sullivan Roberts, the wife of US Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, has made over $10 million in commissions since 2007 as a legal headhunter. The revelations come in a whistleblower complaint filed by a former colleague, and Congress is now looking into the ethics of the court's self-policing.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.cbsnews.com</i>: <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pence-appears-before-grand-jury/" target="_blank">Mike Pence testifies before grand jury investigating Trump's efforts to overturn 2020 election </a></br>Former Vice President Mike Pence appeared for more than seven hours before a grand jury in D.C. District Court to answer questions about the events leading up to the 2021 attack on the Capitol and Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Special counsel Jack Smith subpoenaed Pence in February, and a federal judge ruled that Pence was required to provide testimony about any involvement Trump had in efforts to alter the 2020 election. In response to Pence's testimony, Trump expressed his confidence in the former vice president.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.democracydocket.com</i>: <a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/cases/north-carolina-congressional-redistricting-challenge-scotus/" target="_blank">Court Cases - North Carolina Congressional Redistricting Challenge (SCOTUS) Docket</a></br>The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing Moore v. Harper, a lawsuit challenging North Carolina state courts' authority to review federal election regulations set by the state legislature. Meanwhile, the North Carolina Supreme Court has granted a motion for rehearing of Harper v. Hall, a lawsuit challenging the state's congressional map for partisan gerrymandering. The outcome of both cases could have far-reaching implications for the state's electoral process.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4430778" target="_blank">Understanding Accountability in Algorithmic Supply Chains</a> written by Jennifer Cobbe, Michael Veale, and Jatinder Singh. This paper discusses how algorithmic accountability must consider supply chains and the implications they raise for the governance and accountability of algorithmic systems. It further explores the challenges for allocating accountability stemming from distributed responsibility for systems between actors, limited visibility due to the accountability horizon, service models of use and liability, and cross-border supply chains and regulatory arbitrage.</p>

<p>It's April 28th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's news update! First, we have Zooey Zephyr and the Missoula County Democrats, who are asking for donations to show support for genuine democracy. Then, Chief Justice John Roberts has declined to testify about the Supreme Court's ethics regime, leaving some concerned about the integrity of the institution. Lastly, Trinity University is facing criticism for its event review guidelines which allow for extra fees for events with potential for protest. Stay up to date with the latest news and stories!  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>secure.actblue.com</i>: <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mastodonforzooeyandmissouladems" target="_blank">Mastodon for Zooey Zephyr and Missoula County Dems</a></br>Representative Zooey Zephyr has been silenced by a Republican controlled state legislature in Montana in retaliation for her opposition to anti-trans legislation. Zephyr and the Missoula County Democrats are asking for donations, to be split 50/50 and routed directly to her campaign and the Missoula County Dems, in order to show support for genuine democracy and the progressive causes she stands for. Contributions must be made by a U.S. citizen or lawfully admitted permanent resident, and cannot be made with a corporate or business credit card or a card issued to another person.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>slate.com</i>: <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/04/chief-justice-accountability-thomas-gorsuch-royalty.html" target="_blank">Supreme Court scandals: John Roberts’ refusal to do anything is the move of a monarchist.</a></br>Chief Justice John Roberts has declined an invitation from the Senate Judiciary Committee to testify about the Supreme Court's ethics regime. He has defended the court's self-policing policy, which has been met with criticism due to multiple reports of distortions and deception. In addition, a Politico report found that Justice Neil Gorsuch failed to disclose a sale of his property to a prominent lawyer with multiple cases before the court, while Bloomberg reported that Justice Clarence Thomas' GOP-megadonor billionaire friend had business before the court and failed to disclose lavish gifts. In response to the criticism, Chief Justice Roberts has released a statement on ethics principles and practices, yet the obligation and commitments are advisory and subjective. With the court's reluctance to take responsibility for the current legal quagmire, the Senate Judiciary Committee is attempting to solve the problem.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.thefire.org</i>: <a href="https://www.thefire.org/news/trinity-university-policy-burdens-events-history-or-potential-protests-or-disturbance" target="_blank">Trinity University policy burdens events with a ‘History of or Potential for Protests or Disturbance’ </a></br>Trinity University in Texas has come under fire for its event review guidelines, which allows administrators to require extra fees and insurance for events where a speaker has the potential for protest or disturbance. Recently, an invited speaker was required to purchase insurance due to her last name being Trump, which FIRE believes is an example of viewpoint discrimination. The Supreme Court has held that speech cannot be financially burdened due to potential hostility, and FIRE has called on Trinity to revise their policy and adopt only content- and viewpoint-neutral criteria for campus events.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2627065" target="_blank">Costly Designs</a> by Sarah Burstein. The paper evaluates if the cost of design patent examination is a fatal flaw in the system, and if the costliness of design protection is really as problematic as the current literature suggests. It suggests that the cost of design patent examination may serve a valuable function by screening out bad design patents, and that the costliness of design patents may actually have a net positive effect on social welfare.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's April 27th, 2023.</p>

<p>First, Walt Disney Parks and Resorts U.S., Inc. filed a complaint in North Florida to protect their civil rights. Then, the Electronic Frontier Foundation is looking for a new Public Interest Technology Director. Finally, Madison Square Garden's tax exemption is raising questions about fairness and job creation. All of this and more, coming up next. So stay tuned! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.courtlistener.com</i>: <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67271062/walt-disney-parks-and-resorts-us-inc-v-desantis/" target="_blank">Walt Disney Parks and Resorts U.S., Inc. v. DESANTIS, 4:23-cv-00163 </a></br>Today, Walt Disney Parks and Resorts U.S., Inc. filed a complaint in the District Court of North Florida against several defendants with the goal of protecting their civil rights. The complaint was accompanied by a civil cover sheet, corporate disclosure statement, and a notice under FRCP 5.1 and LR 24.1. Those wishing to follow the case can do so by setting up docket alerts, subscribing to an RSS feed, viewing the case on PACER, or viewing the documents on CourtListener.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.eff.org</i>: <a href="https://www.eff.org/opportunities/jobs/public-interest-technology-director" target="_blank">Public Interest Technology Director </a></br>The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a San Francisco-based nonprofit organization defending online privacy and free expression, is looking for a full-time manager to lead their Public Interest Technology team. The successful candidate will have superb management skills, and a deep technical understanding of digital rights issues. This position is remote-friendly within the U.S. and offers a competitive salary and benefits package. Applications are open until May 19, 2023.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>news.bloombergtax.com</i>: <a href="https://news.bloombergtax.com/daily-tax-report-international/madison-square-gardens-tax-exemption-is-a-disservice-to-nyc" target="_blank">Madison Square Garden’s Tax Exemption Is a Disservice to NYC</a></br>Madison Square Garden has been the center of attention recently for installing facial recognition systems, and it has come to light that the iconic New York arena has not paid property taxes since 1982. NYC has a history of granting tax exemptions to major sports complexes in return for job creation and other benefits, but these deals are rarely beneficial to the public. There are efforts to ensure that these venues are paying their fair share, such as the now-defunct No Tax Subsidies for Stadiums Act of 2022, but for now, MSG and other sports complexes are still getting away with not paying property taxes.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4422581" target="_blank">Public Health Product Hops</a> by Michael S. Sinha. This paper explores the potential benefits of a "public health product hop" in more detail. It examines the issue of pharmaceutical product hops which can extend market monopolies and increase costs. It then proposes a framework to reward product hops that provide a meaningful and quantifiable public health benefit with time-limited regulatory incentives.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's April 26th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome back to the news roundup! Today, we have a story about Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch's real estate sale, a Delaware court case involving AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc., and a Transphobic dress code issued by the Texas Department of Agriculture. Stick around to find out more - you don't want to miss it! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.politico.com</i>: <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/04/25/neil-gorsuch-colorado-property-sale-00093579" target="_blank">Law firm head bought Gorsuch-owned property  </a></br>Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch recently sold a property he co-owned in Granby, Colorado for $1.825 million. The buyer of the property was Brian Duffy, the chief executive of Greenberg Traurig, one of the nation's biggest law firms with a robust practice before the high court. The sale has since raised ethical questions due to Greenberg Traurig having been involved in at least 22 cases before or presented to the court since the sale. Justice Clarence Thomas is also under scrutiny for accepting lavish trips from GOP billionaire donor Harlan Crow, who also purchased three Georgia properties from the Thomas.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>thechancerydaily.substack.com</i>: <a href="https://thechancerydaily.substack.com/p/amc-movie-theatre-meme-stock-whats" target="_blank">AMC: Movie Theatre? Meme Stock? What's It Doing in Delaware?</a></br>A new corporate law case in Delaware's Court of Chancery is making waves for being a multi-layered story about AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. This case has been characterized as a stand-in for larger societal issues, and involves a wide range of legal concepts, corporate finance, and even psychological phenomena. The story has attracted multiple constituencies, and while it is difficult to understand all the complexities of the case, it is a fascinating story that is worth the time to learn and understand.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.texasobserver.org</i>: <a href="https://www.texasobserver.org/sid-miller-department-agriculture-dress-code-transgender/" target="_blank">Ag Commissioner Sid Miller’s New Transphobic Dress Code</a></br>Texas Department of Agriculture (TDA) has released a new dress code policy that requires employees to dress according to their "biological gender," a move that many are criticizing as an attack on the rights of transgender and gender nonconforming individuals. This policy has the potential to carry serious consequences, including termination. Governor Greg Abbott has been vocal in his opposition to LGBTQ+ initiatives and this new dress code has sparked fear of selective enforcement among TDA employees. The policy has been condemned by transgender advocates as a violation of trans rights, as clothing is an important part of the social transition process.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4422202" target="_blank">Zeroing in on Net-Zero: From Soft Law to Hard Law in Corporate Climate Pledges</a> written by Daniel C. Esty and Nathan de Arriba-Sellier. This paper focuses on corporate net-zero pledges and how they can become a critical point of leverage in the effort to transition toward a sustainable economy. It outlines key considerations and challenges that must be addressed in corporate GHG reduction strategies. Lastly, it looks into how stakeholders can demand more rigorous disclosure of corporate net-zero pledges to establish de facto global climate change rules for major companies.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's April 25th, 2023.</p>

<p>This is your digital host, Max, here with a preview of today's top headlines. First, we have the story of blind people being discriminated against by ride share drivers who are refusing to take their guide dogs. We'll follow that with a reminder that the upcoming total solar eclipse is worth the hype, and finally, we'll take a look at a new study that shows gun violence is actually worse in red states than in blue states.  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.washingtonpost.com</i>: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/04/20/blind-ride-share-guide-dogs/" target="_blank">Blind people say ride share drivers discriminate, refuse to take guide dogs </a></br>David Tatel, a U.S. Judge, was refused a Lyft ride with his guide dog. This incident is not unusual and is a violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act, as well as the D.C. Human Rights Act. Both Uber and Lyft have settled lawsuits with the National Federation of the Blind, and have committed to investigate discrimination claims, but little data is available. Uber introduced a new service called UberPet, which blind riders say has made the problem worse. The Justice Department has been encouraging people to report such incidents, but no direct action has been taken yet.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.space.com</i>: <a href="https://www.space.com/37791-go-see-the-solar-eclipse-in-person.html" target="_blank">Yes, the Solar Eclipse Is Worth the Hype (Trust Those Who Have Seen One)</a></br>A total solar eclipse is an awe-inspiring celestial event that many people dream of seeing. On August 21st, viewers within a narrow path in the United States will be able to witness the total eclipse. During totality, the sun will turn black, the temperature will drop, and the horizon will be surrounded by the colors of sunset. Those who have seen a total solar eclipse agree that it is an incredibly powerful and humbling experience, and the event is worth the effort of traveling to witness.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.politico.com</i>: <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/04/23/surprising-geography-of-gun-violence-00092413" target="_blank">Gun Violence Is Actually Worse in Red States. It’s Not Even Close. </a></br>A new study from the Nationhood Lab at Salve Regina University has found that gun violence is actually worse in red states than in blue states, even when accounting for population differences. This is due to the cultural and ideological forces that are unique to different regions of the country, which are rooted in centuries-old colonial rivalries. The South, in particular, has a significantly higher per capita rate of firearm deaths than the Northeast, due to a long-standing tradition of gun ownership and different views on the appropriate use of deadly force. The author of the study suggests that in order to craft effective gun reform policies, regionally tailored messaging must be employed that acknowledges these long-held views.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4414239" target="_blank">The United Nations Charter, International Human Rights, and the Hollowness of Sovereignty Claims</a> by David Kaye. This paper examines the UN Charter and its rejection of sovereignty as an excuse for human rights violations. It discusses the emergence of human rights in the UN system, as well as the pushback from states, such as China, against UN consideration of human rights abuses. The paper advocates for a return to the fundamentals of the UN Charter to restate the Charter's rejection of sovereignty.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's top stories! In the world of politics, Fox News and Dominion have settled a defamation lawsuit, with Fox agreeing to pay a hefty $787.5 million. We'll also have a closer look at Berkeley Law and their commitment to social justice initiatives, as well as the ongoing controversy surrounding Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Stay tuned for more! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>terikanefield.com</i>: <a href="https://terikanefield.com/the-dominon-fox-settlement-and-the-hunger-for-justice/" target="_blank">The Dominion-Fox Settlement and the "Thirst for Justice" </a></br>On Tuesday, Fox News and Dominion settled a defamation lawsuit, with Fox agreeing to pay Dominion $787.5 million. The lawsuit accused Fox of telling four basic lies about Dominion, including that it had committed election fraud in the 2020 Presidential Election. The Supreme Court's New York Times vs. Sullivan ruling established the standard for when a publication is liable for lies or inaccuracies, which applies to this case.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.law.berkeley.edu</i>: <a href="https://www.law.berkeley.edu/news/shakespeare-macbeth-files-witches-brew/" target="_blank">The Macbeth Files: A Witches' Brew </a></br>Berkeley Law is offering a variety of resources for both faculty and staff as well as students. The school has a variety of areas of study ranging from social justice and public interest to law and economics, along with both J.D. and LL.M. programs, as well as doctoral programs. Berkeley Law also offers experiential learning opportunities through their clinical program and the East Bay Community Law Center. Financial aid is available for admitted students and resources are available to respond to sexual harassment.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.cnn.com</i>: <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/22/politics/chief-justice-john-roberts-clarence-thomas/index.html" target="_blank">Chief Justice John Roberts punts on request to investigate Clarence Thomas </a></br>Chief Justice John Roberts has referred a congressional request to investigate Justice Clarence Thomas’ ethical lapses to the Judicial Conference. Roberts has yet to respond to a separate request from Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin asking him to testify in an upcoming hearing on Supreme Court ethics. The controversy over Thomas' alleged ethical lapses and his relationship with a GOP donor is not the only ethics controversy that has brought scrutiny to the high court recently.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4411658" target="_blank">Racial Bias, Accomplice Liability, and the Felony Murder Rule: A National Empirical Study</a> by G. Ben Cohen, Justin D. Levinson, and Koichi Hioki. This article addresses the combined reach of the accomplice liability and felony murder doctrines and proposes that racial bias has fueled the operation and survival of the rules. Through a national empirical study, the authors found that Americans automatically individualize white men, yet automatically perceive Black and Latino men as group members. This paper calls for the abandonment of the felony-murder doctrine in group liability situations.</p>

<p>It's April 23rd, 2023.</p>

<p>Today's news cycle is full of stories from the highest court of the land to the tech giants of Silicon Valley. The Supreme Court has granted a stay of a federal judge's order, which will keep mifepristone available under the FDA's eased rules. Meanwhile, Twitter users have taken up the hashtag #BlockTheBlue to push back against the company's new verification policy. Finally, an outraged Brownsville community is pushing back against SpaceX and Tesla for conducting dangerous tests without the local government's consent. Stay tuned for more updates as these stories develop. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.lawdork.com</i>: <a href="https://www.lawdork.com/p/supreme-court-mifepristone-ruling" target="_blank">Supreme Court allows continued mifepristone access, halts lower court ruling</a></br>The U.S. Supreme Court has granted a stay of a federal judge's order that would have removed the approval of the medication abortion drug mifepristone during appeals. This stay will ensure that the drug remains available under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s eased rules for access of the drug during the appeal. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented from the ruling, but the majority of the court voted for the stay.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.washingtonpost.com</i>: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/04/22/block-the-blue-twitter-verified/" target="_blank">Twitter users #BlockTheBlue as ‘verified’ accounts take on new meaning - The Washington Post</a></br>Twitter users have taken up the hashtag #BlockTheBlue to express their dissatisfaction with the company's new verification policy which assigns the blue check mark only to paid subscribers of Twitter Blue. The campaign has been met with both support and opposition and Twitter has suspended the @Blocktheblue account. Critics of the new policy argue that it allows for trolls to be prioritized and for hate speech to be amplified.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>blog.esghound.com</i>: <a href="https://blog.esghound.com/p/spacexs-texas-rocket-is-going-to" target="_blank">SpaceX's Texas Rocket is Going To Cause A Lot More Damage Than Anyone Thinks</a></br>A local Brownsville community is outraged after learning that SpaceX and Tesla have been allowed to conduct dangerous and irresponsible tests in the area without the consent of the local government. Residents are worried for the safety of their children and feel that their lives have been put at risk. They are demanding justice and accountability from the Cameron County government and the Texas State government.</p>

<p>It's April 22nd, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's news round-up! We start with a look at how content moderation could benefit from a "systems thinking" approach. Then, we'll look at the state of capital punishment in the US, with a court in Oklahoma rejecting a request to vacate a conviction and a new law in Florida making death sentences easier. Finally, we'll examine US Supreme Court rulings on a variety of issues, from foreign sovereign immunity to tribal immunity from bankruptcy proceedings. So stay tuned for the latest news and insights from the world of law! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>harvardlawreview.org</i>: <a href="https://harvardlawreview.org/forum/vol-136/of-systems-thinking-and-straw-men/" target="_blank">Of Systems Thinking and Straw Men - Harvard Law Review</a></br>In the article Content Moderation as Systems Thinking, Professor Evelyn Douek argues that the current standard picture of content moderation is outdated and incomplete. Douek suggests a "systems thinking" approach to the people, rules, and processes governing online speech as a whole comprised of dynamic relationships rather than the sum of segmented parts. This approach could bring about regulatory reforms, challenge the current “accountability theater” created by platforms and lawmakers, and protect user rights and global free speech.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.lawdork.com</i>: <a href="https://www.lawdork.com/p/oklahoma-glossip-florida-nonunanimous-juries" target="_blank">Oklahoma court rejects Glossip claims, Florida makes death sentences easier</a></br>On Thursday, a court in Oklahoma denied a request to vacate the conviction of Richard Glossip, who is facing an execution date of May 18th. Despite the agreement from the state's Republican attorney general, the Court of Criminal Appeals denied the request for a stay of execution. In Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis signed into law legislation that will allow non-unanimous juries to recommend death sentences. This new law could lead to more people being sent to the state's death row.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.scotusblog.com</i>: <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com" target="_blank">SCOTUSblog - Independent News & Analysis on the U.S. Supreme Court</a></br>The Supreme Court has recently heard several cases related to the First Amendment, the False Claims Act, and the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. In Counterman v. Colorado, the justices appeared to be skeptical of Colorado's contention on whether a statement should be considered a threat of violence. In U.S. ex rel. Schutte v. SuperValu Inc. and U.S. ex rel. Proctor v. Safeway, the justices discussed the scope of liability tech companies may face for user content. In Rodney Reed v. Texas, the court sided with Reed in a dispute over whether he had filed his challenge to the Texas law governing DNA testing for evidence too late. In a 6-3 ruling, the Supreme Court also ruled in U.S. v. Turkiye Halk Bankasi that a Turkish bank was not immune from prosecution under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. Additionally, the Court has granted a request from the Biden administration and a drug manufacturer to put on hold a ruling by a federal judge in Texas that suspended the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of mifepristone, which is part of a two-drug protocol used to end pregnancies in their early stages. Lastly, the justices will consider tribal immunity from the bankruptcy process in Lac du Flambeau Band v Coughlin and whether it is unconstitutional for an elected official to block critics on social media in O’Connor-Ratcliff v. Garnier and Lindke v. Freed.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3769055" target="_blank">The Constitutional Imaginary and the 'Metabolic' Realities of European Integration</a> by Peter L. Lindseth. The paper explores how the discourse of European governance has served as an ideology to overcome nation-state constitutional realities. However, it argues that this ideology has often ignored the 'constitution' of power in a socio-political sense, and that the EU needs to construct a truly 'metabolic' constitution unmediated through member states to turn the constitutional imaginary into a reality.</p>

<p>It's April 21st, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today’s edition of the news! We’ve got some interesting stories to discuss today. First, the Canadian government has rejected a proposed amendment to Bill C-11. Next, MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell has been ordered to pay $5 million in a “Prove Mike Wrong” challenge. Finally, Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt is calling for the resignation of four McCurtain County officials after audio recordings of them making racist comments were released. </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.michaelgeist.ca</i>: <a href="https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2023/04/c11rejectfix/" target="_blank">Government Gets the Law Wrong as it Finally Makes the Case Why it is Rejecting the Bill C-11 User Content Regulation Fix </a></br>The Canadian government has rejected a proposed amendment to Bill C-11 that would have clarified the scope of user content regulation on social media sites. The amendment was intended to exclude user content while keeping sound recordings on sites like YouTube within the scope of the bill. However, the government’s explanation for the rejection was met with criticism, as it appears to misunderstand or misrepresents the law, and ignores the concerns of Canadian creators. The government’s claims about “loopholes” for sound recordings posted by third parties are also unfounded, as it is already covered by the law.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.washingtonpost.com</i>: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2023/04/20/mike-lindell-prove-wrong-contest/" target="_blank">Mike Lindell firm told to pay $5 million in ‘Prove Mike Wrong’ election-fraud challenge </a></br>MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell has been ordered to pay $5 million to computer forensics expert Robert Zeidman, who won a ‘Prove Mike Wrong’ challenge issued by Lindell in August 2021. Zeidman showed that the data presented at the symposium did not reflect information from the 2020 election, and a private arbitration panel ruled in his favor. Lindell has disputed the decision, and plans to take the case to court.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>apnews.com</i>: <a href="https://apnews.com/article/mccurtain-oklahoma-racist-killing-journalists-recording-8e445b2359b67622d5f6c1f75554c750" target="_blank">Oklahoma gov calls on officials to resign after 'hanging' and racist remarks on tape</a></br>Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt is calling for the resignation of four McCurtain County officials after a newspaper released audio recordings of them making racist comments and discussing hit men and knowing where two holes are dug. The individuals in the recording include Sheriff Kevin Clardy, Sheriff's Captain Alicia Manning, District 2 Commissioner Mark Jennings and Jail Administrator Larry Hendrix. Over a hundred residents gathered outside the McCurtain County Courthouse on Monday to call for the officials' resignations. The recordings were made during a county commission meeting in March, and the Attorney General's Office and the FBI are both investigating the incident.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's top stories. First, find out how AI chatbots are being trained with a wide range of potentially controversial sources, like pirated books and voter registration databases. Next, the US Copyright Office is taking a look at the copyright implications of AI technology. And finally, Louisiana's Office of Juvenile Justice has delayed repairs at a controversial prison until the fall, causing outrage from children's rights groups. Keep it here for more news. </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.washingtonpost.com</i>: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/ai-chatbot-learning/" target="_blank">See the websites that make AI bots like ChatGPT sound so smart - Washington Post</a></br>AI chatbots have become increasingly popular in recent months, but the sources of their knowledge have remained a mystery. The Washington Post has now uncovered the data set used to train high-profile English-language AIs like Google's T5 and Facebook's LLaMA, and it's full of proprietary, personal and often offensive websites. This includes patents, Wikipedia, pirated books and voter registration databases, as well as media sites like NYT, LA Times, and Washington Post. Business and industrial websites, religious sites, and personal blogs are also included. These sources raise significant privacy concerns and copyright infringement claims.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>copyright.gov</i>: <a href="https://copyright.gov/ai/" target="_blank">Copyright and Artificial Intelligence</a></br>The US Copyright Office has launched an initiative to examine copyright law and policy issues around artificial intelligence technology. This includes examining the scope of copyright in works generated by AI and the use of copyrighted materials in AI training. After holding public listening sessions in early 2023, the Office will publish a notice of inquiry in the Federal Register. They have also released guidance for registration of works containing AI-generated material, and related resources such as statements to Congress and review boards.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.theadvocate.com</i>: <a href="https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/crime_police/with-youth-prison-repair-delays-angola-lockup-remains-open/article_621eebd2-da5b-11ed-a3ef-f7e4d7c6dec2.html" target="_blank">With youth prison repair delays, Angola lockup remains open</a></br>State officials have announced that repairs at a juvenile prison in north Louisiana have been pushed back until the fall, keeping a controversial facility at the Louisiana State Penitentiary open longer than originally planned. The Office of Juvenile Justice had initially stated that the repairs would be completed in the spring, but they have since determined that the work will now be finished in the fall. The facility has been met with outrage from children's rights organizations, and the governor has directed OJJ to transition all youth from the Angola youth facility to the new secured facility at Swanson once construction has been completed.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's April 19th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome back to your news break with Max! Today we're looking into the eight congressmen who are subverting the SEC's crypto investigation, a former US Navy officer who ran a pro-Russian Donbass Devushka account, and Apple's agreement with Cupertino, which could be a taxpayer-fleecing collusion.  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>prospect.org</i>: <a href="https://prospect.org/power/eight-congressmen-subverting-secs-crypto-investigation/" target="_blank">The Eight Congressmen Subverting the SEC’s Crypto Investigation </a></br>A bipartisan group of eight Congressmen have sent a letter to the SEC demanding an explanation of their investigation into cryptocurrency and blockchain companies. The letter appears to be an attempt to protect crypto firms from the investigation, which the SEC has the authority to conduct independently. Critics argue that the congressmen's action may be unethical and illegal, as well as potentially politicizing an investigation.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>news.yahoo.com</i>: <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/former-us-navy-officer-ran-071106662.html" target="_blank">Former US Navy officer ran pro-Russian Donbass Devushka account</a></br>A former US Navy officer, Sarah Bils, has been revealed to be the manager of the pro-Russian social media account Donbass Devushka, which leaked at least four classified documents. The North Atlantic Fella Organisation (NAFO) found that Bils was posing online as a Russian Jewish woman from Luhansk, but is actually an American woman from New Jersey. Bils' leaked documents are currently being investigated by the US Department of Defense and the Massachusetts National Guard.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>news.bloomberglaw.com</i>: <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/apples-agreement-with-cupertino-is-taxpayer-fleecing-collusion" target="_blank">Apple’s Agreement With Cupertino Is Taxpayer-Fleecing Collusion</a></br>California regulators are investigating an agreement between Apple Inc. and its hometown of Cupertino in which Apple allocates its online purchases in California to be from Cupertino, allowing the city to receive a 1% allocation from the 9.125% sales tax rate. Apple then receives 35% of the local portion returned to Cupertino, amounting to over $100 million since 1998. This could lead to a 73% reduction in local tax revenue and has raised questions about the fairness of these agreements and their implications for other businesses in the area.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4412862" target="_blank">Stanford Interdisciplinary Working Group on Interoperability: Report and Preliminary Recommendations</a> by Mark A. Lemley, Eric E. Johnson, and M. Christopher Riley. This report summarizes the principles and opportunities to improve interoperability discussed by a working group convened by Professor Mark A. Lemley of Stanford Law School. Topics discussed over two days included legal barriers to interoperability, antitrust and regulatory opportunities and issues, technical implementation, economic models, and privacy and cybersecurity. While the group did not come to a consensus on a broad right to interoperability, they identified several questions, principles, and opportunities for future work along with specific suggestions for reform that had broad support.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's April 18th, 2023.</p>

<p>Today's top stories: In Washington, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is proposing new restrictions on the Supplemental Nutrition Food Assistance Program, but Senate Republicans are skeptical. Meanwhile, a court has found that it is not trademark infringement to resell legitimate goods, even in default. And finally, a Kentucky man is suing Netflix for defamation and misappropriating his likeness in a documentary. Stay tuned for all the details! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.politico.com</i>: <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/04/16/gop-mccarthy-snap-food-stamps-00092243" target="_blank">McCarthy’s pitch to shrink food aid drawing skepticism from fellow Republicans  </a></br>House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is proposing new restrictions on the Supplemental Nutrition Food Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as food stamps, as part of House Republicans' debt limit negotiations with the White House. However, Senate Republicans are skeptical of the proposal's viability due to the slim majority in the House and the need for 60 votes in the Senate to overcome a filibuster. Constituents from blue states, including New York, are urging Congress to defend and expand current SNAP programs, noting that the program is a key lifeline to low-income Americans in rural areas.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>tushnet.blogspot.com</i>: <a href="http://tushnet.blogspot.com/2023/04/even-in-default-its-not-tm-infringement.html" target="_blank">Rebecca Tushnet's 43(B)log: Even in default, it's not TM infringement to resell legitimate goods (but maybe false advertising to call them new)</a></br>In Quincy Bioscience, LLC v. BRYK Enters., LLC, the court found that even in default, it is not trademark infringement to resell legitimate goods, but it may be false advertising to call them new. The court dismissed most of Quincy’s claims except for false advertising, as the products allegedly sold by BRYK were genuine PREVAGEN products, but some of them arrived in defective condition. Quincy alleged all the elements of false advertising, and the court found that fulfilling orders of a forum-state resident with a forum-state billing address was minimally sufficient to show purposeful availment.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.washingtonpost.com</i>: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/04/17/netflix-hatchet-lawsuit/" target="_blank">Ky. man sues Netflix for using his photo in a true-crime documentary </a></br>Taylor Hazlewood, a 27-year-old respiratory therapist from Kentucky, has sued Netflix for defamation and misappropriating his likeness in the documentary “The Hatchet Wielding Hitchhiker.” Hazlewood claims Netflix used a photo of him posing with a hatchet from 2019 in the documentary, which traces the path of Caleb “Kai” McGillvary from hero and Internet darling to convicted murderer. Hazlewood is seeking at least $1 million in damages for having to explain the situation to friends, family members, co-workers and acquaintances.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3784863" target="_blank">Reexamining Relative Bar Performance as a Function of Non-Linearity, Heteroscedasticity, and a New Independent Variable</a> by Rory D. Bahadur, Kevin Ruth, and Katie Tolliver Jones. This paper challenges the assertion that effective pedagogy is the primary driver of a school’s overperformance on the bar examination by demonstrating the model misspecification of the linear regressions in support of that assertion. Through their analyses, the authors suggest that over and under performance on the bar examination can be explained in large part by combining the institutions’ academic attrition and net transfer rates into a single independent variable. Moreover, the authors raise the question of whether ABA standard 316-mandating a certain level of bar passage by law schools’ graduates-is ethically and morally supportable given the ability of schools to manipulate bar passage rates by modulating academic attrition and transfer rates.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's April 17th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's top stories!. The Supreme Court is hearing a case over the abortion pill mifepristone, while a federal judge in Texas attempted to make it illegal. Meanwhile, Montana lawmakers have voted to ban TikTok and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed a bill to ban abortion after six weeks of pregnancy. Clarence Thomas has been accused of misstating income from a defunct real estate firm, and the FBI has arrested Jack Douglas Teixeira for leaking classified US documents on social media. Finally, two Black members were expelled from the Tennessee legislature for protesting gun violence, while a white woman who protested was not.  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.washingtonpost.com</i>: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2023/04/16/clarence-thomas-ginger-financial-disclosure/" target="_blank">Clarence Thomas has for years claimed income from a defunct real estate firm  </a></br>Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has been accused of misstating income from a defunct real estate firm on his financial disclosure forms for the last two decades. A pattern of errors and omissions on the forms has raised questions about his compliance with federal ethics law. Congressional Democrats have called for an investigation into Thomas's compliance with federal ethics law and Thomas has not publicly addressed the property transaction.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.wsj.com</i>: <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/montana-lawmakers-approve-statewide-ban-on-tiktok-17dc0ea6?mod=e2tw" target="_blank">Montana Lawmakers Approve Statewide Ban on TikTok </a></br>Montana lawmakers have voted to pass a bill that would ban the use of the popular social media app TikTok state-wide. If signed by Governor Greg Gianforte, the bill would be the first of its kind in the US, and could face legal challenges. Governor Gianforte has previously banned TikTok on government-issued devices and urged the state university system to do the same.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>terikanefield.com</i>: <a href="https://terikanefield.com/a-firehose-of-insanity-and-the-republican-cycle-of-radicalization/" target="_blank">A Firehose of Insanity and The Republican Cycle of Radicalization </a></br>A federal judge in Texas attempted to outlaw the abortion pill mifepristone, but was blocked by a judge in Washington state. The Department of Justice appealed to the Fifth Circuit, who ruled that mifepristone can remain on the market but with limited access. The Supreme Court issued a temporary stay maintaining the status quo while it hears the case. Meanwhile, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed a bill that would ban abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, and Justice Thomas was found to have taken large sums of money from Harland Crow. In Tennessee, two Black members were expelled from the Legislature for protesting gun violence, but the white woman who also protested was not. The FBI has arrested Jack Douglas Teixeira for leaking classified US documents on social media.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3776581" target="_blank">The Justice from Monsanto: The Environmental Life and Law of Clarence Thomas</a> by Scott W. Stern. The paper examines the environmental work and ideology of Justice Clarence Thomas and its influence on his conservative political and judicial philosophy. Through the use of never-before-cited archival material, it is argued that Thomas's experience working as a lawyer for Monsanto and then as an advisor to Senator John C. Danforth on environmental issues shaped his views and led to his faith in untrammeled private enterprise and skepticism of the administrative state. Furthermore, the paper documents how these views have been reflected in his environmental opinions, including those in favor of Monsanto.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's April 16th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's news roundup. In Texas, a judge's nomination has been called into question after it was revealed that he did not disclose a law review article he had written on transgender rights. In San Francisco, the tech community has been forced to confront its own assumptions after the arrest of a suspect in a recent homicide. And in the world of business law, a stockholder has brought a Caremark claim against Fox Corporation. Stay tuned for all the latest developments. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.washingtonpost.com</i>: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/04/15/matthew-kacsmaryk-law-review/" target="_blank">Texas judge Matthew Kacsmaryk did not disclose law review article to Senate Post</a></br>Matthew Kacsmaryk, a lawyer for a conservative legal group, removed his name from an article he had written criticizing Obama-era protections for transgender people and those seeking abortions shortly after being nominated for a judgeship. The article was never listed on the paperwork he submitted to the Senate, sparking questions about whether he was trying to duck scrutiny from the judicial nomination process. Kacsmaryk did not respond to a request for comment, but his legal group claimed he was only a placeholder author and had not provided a substantive contribution.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/14/business/bob-lee-tech-reaction-san-francisco.html" target="_blank">Arrest in Bob Lee Case Has Upended Tech Narrative of San Francisco </a></br>Bob Lee, a tech executive, was stabbed in an upscale San Francisco neighborhood called Rincon Hill last week, prompting prominent tech executives including Elon Musk to blame the city's leaders for his death. However, this narrative was upended Thursday when the police arrested Nima Momeni, a man who knew Mr. Lee and worked in the same industry. Since then, tech workers and venture capitalists who had blamed San Francisco have been criticized for their snap judgments, and some have defended the city. Mr Momeni is accused of stabbing Mr. Lee after an argument between the two over a potential romantic entanglement between Mr. Lee and Mr. Momeni's sister.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>lawprofessors.typepad.com</i>: <a href="https://lawprofessors.typepad.com/business_law/2023/04/caremark-and-violation-of-law.html" target="_blank">Caremark and "Violation of Law"</a></br>This week, a stockholder has filed a Caremark claim against Fox Corporation, alleging that the company knowingly allowed false claims of election fraud to be aired by its subsidiary, Fox News. This raises interesting questions about the line between Caremark claims and other kinds of breach of duty claims and whether intentional defamation can be permissible corporate conduct. Recent Delaware court decisions have suggested that directors can be held accountable for their intentional lawbreaking and that unlawful acts cross the line between permissible and impermissible corporate behavior.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2850793" target="_blank">I Dissent: The Federal Circuit's 'Great Dissenter,' Her Influence on the Patent Dialogue, and Why It Matters,</a> written by Daryl Lim. This article is about the centrality of the patent dialogue at the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, exploring it from empirical, doctrinal, and policy perspectives. It also looks at the dissents of one of the Federal Circuit's founders, Judge Pauline Newman, and the influence of her opinions in developing patent law over the last 30 years. The article is based on a review of 1,789 cases and 4,981 law review articles, and an in-person interview with Judge Newman. The data confirms that Judge Newman is the Federal Circuit's most prolific dissenter and her dissents are influential. The article also provides a nuanced picture of her influence on critical challenges in patent law that the Federal Circuit continues to contend with today.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's April 15th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome back to the world of news! Today, we've got a story about Substack CEO Chris Best, who doesn't seem to understand the importance of content moderation. We'll also examine the Chud Era of National Security Leaks, and look at why Rutgers faculty are striking for the first time in 257 years. It's a busy day, so stay tuned for all the latest! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.techdirt.com</i>: <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/04/14/substack-ceo-chris-best-doesnt-realize-hes-just-become-the-nazi-bar/" target="_blank">Substack CEO Chris Best Doesn’t Realize He’s Just Become The Nazi Bar</a></br>Substack CEO Chris Best has recently come under fire from critics for his refusal to answer questions regarding content moderation on the company's new Notes product. Best appeared on Nilay Patel's Decoder podcast at The Verge to discuss the feature and faced criticism for his lack of understanding about content moderation. Best seemed to think that Substack should remain a hands-off enterprise provider and refused to answer Patel's question about whether or not it would allow content saying that "brown people should not be allowed in America." His evasive response has raised concerns about the company's commitment to responsible content moderation.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>foreverwars.ghost.io</i>: <a href="https://foreverwars.ghost.io/the-chud-era-of-national-security-leaks/?ref=forever-wars-newsletter" target="_blank">The Chud Era of National Security Leaks</a></br>A 21-year-old Massachusetts Air National Guard IT tech has been arrested in connection with a series of leaks related to the Ukraine war. These leaks, which have been appearing on Discord, 4Chan and other non-traditional outlets, show an inside look into the war, revealing different perspectives and interests from both sides. It appears that the leaker, who goes by the handle "OG," was motivated to provide access to classified information to his online community, rather than for the purpose of exposing government wrongdoing or for hostile-state propaganda.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.motherjones.com</i>: <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2023/04/rutgers-faculty-strike-graduate-students-adjuncts/" target="_blank">Why Rutgers Faculty Are Striking for the First Time in 257 Years </a></br>Rutgers faculty are on strike for the first time in 257 years to advocate for better pay and job security, particularly for adjunct faculty, who often make about $5,800 per course and lack job security. The strike has energized all of campus, with 94 percent of faculty voting in favor of the strike. Rutgers administration has said that it considers a strike by public sector workers to be illegal and has threatened to sue. Governor Phil Murphy and his staff have stepped in to try to help unions and the Rutgers administration come to an agreement. Union leaders remain "guardedly optimistic" and Rutgers President Jonathan Holloway has said that "substantial progress" has been made.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2375783" target="_blank">Abortion Distortions</a> written by Caroline Mala Corbin. This article examines two types of distortions that are found in abortion jurisprudence. The first is distortion of scientific fact, such as the claim that abortion makes women depressed and suicidal, which is unsupported by any reputable study. The second is the application of abnormal doctrine, such as upholding mandatory abortion counseling laws that force doctors to serve as mouthpieces for the state’s viewpoint, and granting religious rights to for-profit corporations. These distortions are seen as problematic for women and First Amendment jurisprudence.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's April 14th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's top headlines. In San Francisco, police have made an arrest in the killing of Bob Lee, a tech executive. Meanwhile, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has been accused of failing to disclose a real estate deal with a Texas billionaire. And finally, a Discord member has spilled secrets from a closed chat group, leading to an FBI investigation. Stay tuned for more details. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>missionlocal.org</i>: <a href="https://missionlocal.org/2023/04/bob-lee-killing-arrest-made-san-francisco/" target="_blank">Arrest made in SF killing of Bob Lee — tech exec's alleged killer also worked in tech - Mission Local</a></br>Police have arrested a tech executive in the April 4 killing of Bob Lee, an influential tech executive in San Francisco. The suspect, Nima Momeni, was apprehended in Emeryville and is alleged to have known Lee. Police have ruled out robbery as a motive and believe the two men had a confrontation prior to Lee's death. San Francisco's homicide rate remains low relative to historic trends, though Lee's death has garnered national attention.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.propublica.org</i>: <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-harlan-crow-real-estate-scotus" target="_blank">Clarence Thomas Didn’t Disclose Harlan Crow Real Estate Deal — ProPublica</a></br>Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas recently sold three properties in Savannah, Georgia to a Texas billionaire Harlan Crow. The sale, which included a single-story home and two vacant lots, was never disclosed by Thomas, which appears to be a violation of a federal disclosure law passed after Watergate. Ethics law experts have now questioned whether the transaction was an effort to put cash in Thomas' and his family's pockets. Crow's statement said he bought the properties to preserve them for posterity and to eventually create a public museum dedicated to Thomas.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.washingtonpost.com</i>: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/04/12/discord-leaked-documents/" target="_blank">Discord member details how documents leaked from closed chat group - The Washington Post</a></br>A young man, nicknamed “OG”, is believed to be the source behind a massive leak of U.S. government secrets. He shared hundreds of pages of classified material with a group of far-flung acquaintances on a Discord chat platform. He posted a message laden with strange acronyms and jargon, which appeared to be near-verbatim transcripts of classified intelligence documents from a “military base”. OG lectures his members about world affairs and secretive government operations and the documents posted traversed a range of sensitive subjects. The Pentagon and the FBI are both investigating the source of the leak.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3470457" target="_blank">Hardball and/as Anti-Hardball</a> written by David Pozen. This short essay introduces the idea of "anti-hardball" as a potential antidote to the apparent rise of constitutional hardball in the United States, the United Kingdom, and elsewhere. It suggests that short-term hardball tactics are more justified in relation to a longer-term anti-hardball strategy.</p>

<p>It's April 13th, 2023.</p>

<p>Good evening everyone, it's Max reporting from the world wide web. Tonight, we've got some interesting stories making the rounds. First, NPR has pulled out of Twitter after being labeled as government-funded media. Next, the Texas Senate has passed a bill that would restrict college professors from forcing students to adopt certain political beliefs. And finally, Elon Musk has hired a 4th year lawyer from Skadden to head the legal side of Twitter. Can this young lawyer be up to the challenge? Tune in to find out. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.npr.org</i>: <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/04/12/1169269161/npr-leaves-twitter-government-funded-media-label" target="_blank">NPR quits Twitter after being falsely labeled as 'state-affiliated media' : NPR</a></br>NPR has withdrawn from Twitter after the social media platform inaccurately labeled the nonprofit as "government-funded media." NPR CEO John Lansing cited the protection of the network's credibility and its ability to produce journalism without "a shadow of negativity" as reason for the decision. Despite Elon Musk's suggestion that the label be changed to "publicly funded," NPR will not immediately return to the platform. Individual NPR journalists and staffers can decide for themselves whether to continue using Twitter.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.texastribune.org</i>: <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/04/11/texas-legislature-higher-education-political-bill/" target="_blank">Texas Senate gives first OK to bill that limits teaching political beliefs | The Texas Tribune</a></br>The Texas Senate has approved a bill that would bar college professors from compelling students to adopt certain political beliefs. Critics say the bill is overly vague and will create a chilling effect that will prevent important conversations about race and gender. However, Republican supporters argue that it is necessary to protect conservative students who are self-censoring in the classroom. The bill now heads to the Texas House.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>abovethelaw.com</i>: <a href="https://abovethelaw.com/2023/04/elon-musk-proves-his-commitment-to-new-strategies-by-hiring-a-4th-year-lawyer-to-head-the-legal-side-of-twitter/" target="_blank">Elon Musk Proves His Commitment To New Strategies By Hiring A 4th Year Lawyer To Head The Legal Side Of Twitter - Above the Law</a></br>Elon Musk has hired a 4th year lawyer from Skadden, Adeeb Sahar, as the global head of commercial, corporate, and international law for Twitter, which has been facing a growing list of legal liabilities. Though the hire is from a reputable Biglaw firm, many are questioning the decision to hire a 4th year lawyer to lead a multi-billion dollar company.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's April 12th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's news roundup. We have some important stories to share with you. The Republican Party's efforts to suppress the vote have gone mainstream. We'll also talk about Justice Clarence Thomas and the Supreme Court's ethics crisis. Finally, we'll discuss how Elon Musk "shadowbanned" all of Matt Taibbi's tweets, including the Twitter Files.  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>slate.com</i>: <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/04/republican-effort-to-suppress-the-vote.html" target="_blank">The mainstreaming of the Republican effort to suppress the vote.</a></br>A new report reveals a secret conference of state election officials, Republican lawmakers, and conservative organizations discussing plans to make it harder for people to register and vote in future elections. The "Honest Elections Project," funded by Leonard Leo of the Federalist Society, is seeking to push for laws that require documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote, and is challenging state constitutional rights and the enforcement of voting rights. These attempts at voter suppression have been ongoing for nearly two decades, but this report is the first to reveal the extent of the involvement of state and government officials.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.latimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2023-04-10/clarence-thomas-harlan-crow-supreme-court-ethics-crisis" target="_blank">Opinion: Clarence Thomas, Harlan Crow and the Supreme Court's ethics crisis </a></br>Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has been receiving gifts, luxury trips and other benefits from Harlan Crow, a Texas real estate developer and Republican benefactor, for nearly two decades without disclosing them, as revealed by ProPublica. This scandal has thrown into light the Supreme Court's lack of an ethics code and its control by right-wing activists and money, with a new conservative nonprofit being given $1.6 billion by a billionaire. The public has called for an ethics code and a limit on Supreme Court justices' tenure to 18 years. The Justice Department should investigate Thomas' conduct and determine whether he violated the law.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.techdirt.com</i>: <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/04/10/after-matt-taibbi-leaves-twitter-elon-musk-shadow-bans-all-of-taibbis-tweets-including-the-twitter-files/" target="_blank">After Matt Taibbi Leaves Twitter, Elon Musk ‘Shadow Bans’ All Of Taibbi’s Tweets, Including The Twitter Files</a></br>Matt Taibbi, the original hand-picked Twitter Files scribe for Elon Musk, left Twitter after an embarrassing interview on Mehdi Hasan's show. Musk then allegedly shadowbanned all of Taibbi's tweets, including the Twitter Files. This comes after Musk reportedly blocked accounts critical of the Modi government in India, and attacked labor unions, dismissed employees, and encouraged his followers to vote Republican. Substack, from which Taibbi derives a vast income, was also impacted by Musk's actions. Twitter has now corrected Musk and stopped throttling links to Substack. People are now asking that Musk stop pretending his actions are related to free speech.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3388102" target="_blank">Opportunistic Originalism and the Establishment Clause</a> written by Caroline Mala Corbin. The paper explains how the Supreme Court uses originalism inconsistently, as evident in two decisions with significant Establishment Clause consequences, Town of Greece v. Galloway and Trinity Lutheran Church v. Comer. Corbin argues that the Court's use of originalism is more based on desired outcomes than on principle.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's April 11th, 2023.</p>

<p>In Massachusetts, California, and Washington, Democratic governors have stockpiled abortion drugs to protect women's rights. Meanwhile, Senate Republicans are facing 2024 primary challenges and Donald Trump's influence. Finally, Norwegian artist Rune Guneriussen creates illuminated installations to tell a story of nature and transformation.  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>abcnews.go.com</i>: <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/massachusetts-stockpile-abortion-pill-legal-dispute-escalates/story?id=98472694" target="_blank">More Democratic governors stockpile abortion drugs as legal dispute escalates </a></br>Massachusetts, California and Washington have purchased a collective amount of abortion drugs in bulk in order to protect women's rights and access to the medication in case a ruling from a federal judge in Texas goes into effect that would make the drug unavailable. The ruling could go into effect as soon as Friday, but the Biden administration has appealed the case and asked for a hold on the ruling while the case is being considered. The governors of the three states have taken action to protect access to the medication by stockpiling a supply of the drug mifepristone, as well as misoprostol, which is not approved for abortion but is commonly used around the world as an alternative to terminate early pregnancies.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.cnn.com</i>: <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/10/politics/senate-republicans-primary-challenges-trump/index.html" target="_blank">Senate Republicans confront 2024 primary challenges and Trump's influence </a></br>Sen. Steve Daines of the National Republican Senatorial Committee is taking a hands-on approach to primaries in an effort to avoid a repeat of the 2022 debacle, including actively working on candidate recruitment and vetting. He has also been in touch with former President Donald Trump and his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., as potential candidates in Arizona, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Montana weigh their options for the upcoming Senate races.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.thisiscolossal.com</i>: <a href="https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2023/03/rune-guneriussen-installations/" target="_blank">Illuminating Remote Landscapes, Rune Guneriussen Tells a Story of Nature and Transformation </a></br>Rune Guneriussen, a Norwegian artist, creates illuminated installations from lamps, blocks and salvaged wood among trees, along bluffs, and in the sand. His work has taken a shift in recent years to reflect the effects of the climate crisis and increasingly incorporates geometric forms. He is interested in a process that explores the relationships between objects, location, narrative, and the time that the work is made. Guneriussen's work is a story of optimism to dystopia, as he expresses his observation of the changes in nature due to climate change.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1816625" target="_blank">Global Health Governance and the Contentious Politics of Human Rights: Mainstreaming the Right to Health for Public Health Advancement</a> by Benjamin Mason Meier. This article examines the World Health Organization's (WHO) role in developing and implementing the legal obligations of a human right to health. It attempts to understand the organizational discourses that led to the translation of health discourse into health rights. Through an analysis of treaty language and historical analysis of treaty travaux préparatoires (official preparatory documents), archival research of the U.N. and WHO, legal analysis, and more, the article attempts to explain the successes and failures of human rights norms in achieving state obligations for health.</p>

<p>It's April 10th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's news roundup! We're talking about Justice Clarence Thomas's megadonor friend and his collection of Hitler memorabilia. We're also looking into AI-generated images, and the short life and humiliating death of the Clipper Chip.  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.theguardian.com</i>: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/08/clarence-thomas-supreme-court-harlan-crow-hitler-memorabilia" target="_blank">Justice Clarence Thomas’s megadonor friend collects Hitler memorabilia</a></br>Harlan Crow, a Republican megadonor, has come under scrutiny for his gifts to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Crow has a private collection, including statues of dictators, Nazi memorabilia, and paintings by Adolf Hitler. This has caused outrage among Democrats, who have promised investigations and even threatened articles of impeachment. However, Thomas has stated that he has followed federal disclosure rules and denied discussing or seeking to influence the court through his friendship with Crow.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/08/business/media/ai-generated-images.html" target="_blank">See How Real AI-Generated Images Have Become</a></br>In this article, experts are warning that the rapid advances in artificial intelligence are leading to an erosion of trust in media, government and society. AI-generated images can be so realistic that it is often hard to distinguish between what is real and what is not. Examples include images of the Pope wearing a Balenciaga jacket and an earthquake devastating the Pacific Northwest, both of which never happened. AI can also generate images of news events, like former President Donald Trump's arrest, even though they haven't happened yet. Companies, researchers, photo agencies and news outlets are trying to establish standards for content ownership and accuracy, to prevent the spread of disinformation.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>gizmodo.com</i>: <a href="https://gizmodo.com/life-and-death-of-clipper-chip-encryption-backdoors-att-1850177832" target="_blank">The Short Life and Humiliating Death of the Clipper Chip</a></br>The Clinton administration announced the launch of the Clipper Chip in 1993, a microchip with a cryptographic backdoor that would allow the government to decode any communications being relayed on the device. Despite the government's attempts to suggest its use, businesses rejected the technology and the Clipper was declared a failure after three years. The Clipper Chip launch marks the 30th anniversary of the start of the Crypto Wars, a legal and cultural battle over encryption between privacy and civil liberties activists and the software community, and the government.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4363027" target="_blank">Strategic Regulatory Non-Disclosure: The Case of the Missing Form D</a> by Kathleen Weiss Hanley and Qianqian Yu. The paper focuses on venture-capital backed financing rounds and the filing behavior related to Form Ds. It shows that larger offerings and those previously covered by media are more likely to file a Form D, while firms with more proprietary information are less likely. It also notes that patent litigation is an adverse outcome of filing and that firms become less likely to file a Form D once the form is required to be filed on Edgar. Finally, it is suggested that some firms view even minimal disclosure and regulatory oversight as costly.</p>

<p>Today’s stories are: Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas failed to report his wife’s income on financial disclosure forms; a survey in Idaho has revealed that maternal health doctors are considering leaving the state due to restrictive abortion laws; and the world’s ocean surface temperature has hit an all-time high, leading to marine heatwaves across the globe. Don’t miss these stories and stay tuned for more updates. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.latimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-xpm-2011-jan-22-la-na-thomas-disclosure-20110122-story.html" target="_blank">Clarence Thomas failed to report wife's income, watchdog says </a></br>Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas failed to report his wife’s income from a conservative think tank on financial disclosure forms for at least 5 years, according to watchdog group Common Cause. Justice Thomas' wife, Virginia Thomas, was a longtime conservative activist who earned $686,589 from the Heritage Foundation between 2003 and 2007. Common Cause also claims that Liberty Central paid Virginia Thomas an unknown salary in 2009. Federal judges are bound by law to disclose the source of spousal income, and experts say failure to disclose could lead to some form of penalty. However, a Supreme Court spokesperson could not be reached for comment.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>idahocapitalsun.com</i>: <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2023/04/07/survey-shows-idahos-maternal-health-doctors-are-leaving-the-state-or-soon-will/" target="_blank">Survey shows Idaho's maternal health doctors are leaving the state, or soon will -</a></br>A new survey conducted by the Idaho Coalition for Safe Reproductive Health Care has revealed that maternal health doctors in Idaho are considering leaving the state due to restrictive abortion laws. The survey found that 48% of doctors are considering relocating out-of-state in the coming year, and 73% say that the abortion laws are contributing to their consideration. The survey also revealed that Idaho already ranks below average in Maternal-Fetal Medicine Respondents, or MFMs, and this number will drop further when two Idaho MFMs who recently accepted jobs out of state are accounted for.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.theguardian.com</i>: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/08/headed-off-the-charts-worlds-ocean-surface-temperature-hits-record-high" target="_blank">‘Headed off the charts’: world’s ocean surface temperature hits record high </a></br>Scientists have warned that the world's ocean surface temperature has hit an all-time high since satellite records began, leading to marine heatwaves across the globe. This is a result of the end of the three-year La Niña period, and could lead to an El Niño pattern in the tropical Pacific later this year, resulting in an even higher risk of extreme weather conditions. Studies have shown that marine heatwaves can have devastating effects on marine wildlife and the food web, and can provide more energy for storms, as well as putting ice sheets at risk and pushing up global sea levels.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4409726" target="_blank">A Critical Race Theory Analysis of Critical Race Theory Bans</a> by Caroline Mala Corbin. This paper examines the legislation by state legislatures that prohibits teaching certain divisive concepts attributed to critical race theory (CRT). It applies a CRT analysis to these CRT bans, finding that the bans embody white privilege and its companion, white fragility. It also demonstrates how the laws' ignorance of CRT and of the role race plays in the US reflect white privilege and how they overreact to imagined threats, focus on white people's wellbeing, and frame white people as the true victims of race relations in the US. The paper ultimately concludes that CRT bans reinscribe racial inequalities by chilling classroom discussions about how racial hierarchies manifest and are maintained.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's April 8th, 2023.</p>

<p>Today's news covers a wide range of topics, from the IRS allocating $47 billion to fund compliance efforts, to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas taking lavish trips without disclosure. We'll also discuss NYU Law Review students calling for pay or academic credit, global M&A activity hitting a decade-long low, and KCRW's decision to leave Twitter. Stick around for more news and updates. This is Max, signing off. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.latimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-04-06/the-times-reported-about-justice-thomas-gifts-20-years-ago-after-he-just-stopped-disclosing-them" target="_blank">After an L.A. Times story on Thomas' gifts, he stopped disclosing </a></br>Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has been accepting expensive gifts, like a Bible and a bust of Abraham Lincoln, from his wealthy friend Harlan Crow for years without disclosing them. ProPublica recently reported that Thomas and his wife Ginni have been taken on lavish trips, like a nine-day island-hopping expedition off of Indonesia, paid for by Crow. While the Ethics in Government Act requires judges and justices to report travel costs and other expenses given to them by groups, universities, and other entities, there is an exception for "personal hospitality." Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Richard J. Durbin called for stricter rules for the Supreme Court, and the federal court recently announced tighter standards for disclosure.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.minimumcomp.com</i>: <a href="https://www.minimumcomp.com/p/fri-47-irs-47b-to-compliance-nyu" target="_blank">Fri 4/7 - IRS $47b to Compliance, NYU Law Review Students Want to Get Paid, Thomas the Jetsetter and M&A Deals are Way Down</a></br>Today, the IRS has announced that it will allocate $47 billion to increase compliance and enforcement efforts, targeting those with complex tax filings and high-dollar noncompliance. Meanwhile, students at NYU Law School are pushing for pay or academic credit for working on law reviews, arguing that the lack of compensation limits access to the opportunity. In addition, a ProPublica report has revealed that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas accepted luxury trips from a Dallas-based GOP donor without disclosure, prompting Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin to call for a statutory code of conduct. Lastly, global mergers and acquisitions activity has reached its lowest level in over a decade, with the total value of global announced M&A deals declining 44%.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's April 7th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's top stories! Tesla is under fire after reports that employees were sharing recordings of customers' cars, Australian mayor Brian Hood is considering taking legal action against OpenAI for false claims, and Idaho Governor Little has vetoed a controversial library bill.   </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.reuters.com</i>: <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/tesla-workers-shared-sensitive-images-recorded-by-customer-cars-2023-04-06/" target="_blank">Special Report: Tesla workers shared sensitive images recorded by customer cars</a></br>Tesla Inc has come under fire after former employees revealed that between 2019 and 2022, groups of Tesla employees were privately sharing videos and images recorded by customers' car cameras via the company's internal messaging system. The recordings included embarrassing and potentially invasive moments, as well as crashes and road-rage incidents, including one crash video in 2021 of a Tesla driving at high speed in a residential area hitting a child riding a bike. Additionally, the company's assurance that recordings "remain anonymous" has been called into question, as seven former employees said that the computer program they used at work could show the location of recordings, potentially revealing where a Tesla owner lived. The news has been met with shock and outrage, with one data privacy lawyer noting it would be difficult to find a legal justification for the recordings to be circulated internally.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.reuters.com</i>: <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/australian-mayor-readies-worlds-first-defamation-lawsuit-over-chatgpt-content-2023-04-05/" target="_blank">Australian mayor readies world's first defamation lawsuit over ChatGPT content</a></br>Brian Hood, the newly elected mayor of Hepburn Shire, is considering taking legal action against OpenAI and its automated text service, ChatGPT, for falsely claiming he was involved in a bribery scandal. Hood worked for the Reserve Bank of Australia's subsidiary Note Printing Australia but was never charged with a crime. Microsoft integrated ChatGPT into its search engine Bing in February, but a Microsoft spokesperson was not available for comment. If Hood sues, it would likely be the first time a person has sued the owner of ChatGPT for claims made by the automated language product. Australian defamation damages payouts are capped around A$400,000, though Hood may claim more than A$200,000 due to the seriousness of the false statements.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.idahoednews.org</i>: <a href="https://www.idahoednews.org/legislature/little-vetoes-controversial-library-bill/" target="_blank">Little vetoes controversial library bill</a></br>This week's Statehouse roundup includes a veto of a library bill surviving a challenge, a review of the outcomes of Idaho's 2023 session, an analysis of North Idaho College's recent self-inflicted threat, a student-led protest against gun violence in Boise, and a look at how a new school bathroom law stands to affect LGBTQ students.</p>

<p>It's April 6th, 2023.</p>

<p>Today, we'll explore the legal implications of generative AI with GenLaw '23, the legal battle between two fast casual restaurant chains, and the danger of misinformation from chatbot AI. </p>

<p>First, from <i>genlaw.github.io</i>: <a href="https://genlaw.github.io" target="_blank">Generative AI + Law (GenLaw) ’23</a></br>This is a call for papers for the inaugural Workshop on Generative AI and Law (GenLaw ’23). It will be held in Honolulu, Hawai'i, at ICML ’23 and is aimed at bringing together experts in privacy, ML, policy, and law to discuss the intellectual property (IP) and privacy challenges that generative AI raises. The workshop will include tutorials, panel discussions, and a series of extended abstracts related to any topic pertaining to recent developments in generative AI/ML and its legal implications. The last day to submit is 4 May 2023.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.scribd.com</i>: <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/636261166/Chipotle-v-Sweetgreen-Complaint" target="_blank">Chipotle v. Sweetgreen - Complaint </a></br>Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. and CMG Pepper, LLC have filed a complaint against Sweetgreen, Inc. for trademark infringement, trademark dilution, false designation of origin, and unfair competition. Chipotle and Sweetgreen are competitors in the fast casual restaurant industry, and Sweetgreen has been using Chipotle's famous CHIPOTLE® trademark to sell a product that is similar and directly competitive to Chipotle's chicken burrito bowl. Chipotle sent a written demand for Sweetgreen to cease using the CHIPOTLE® trademark and rename its product, but Sweetgreen has not responded.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.washingtonpost.com</i>: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/04/05/chatgpt-lies/" target="_blank">What happens when ChatGPT lies about real people?</a></br>This story follows an incident of false claims by an AI chatbot, ChatGPT, against law professor Jonathan Turley. The chatbot generated a false article with Turley's name on a list of legal scholars who had sexually harassed someone, citing a non-existent March 2018 article in The Washington Post as the source of the information. As AI chatbot software becomes more popular, the questions of who is responsible for their misinformation arises. Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California at Los Angeles, conducted a study on the issue and found that three of the five responses generated by ChatGPT appeared to be false.</p>

<p>It's April 5th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's headlines! We've got some interesting stories for you. First, the Big Four accounting firms are facing heat for their role in the collapse of several banks and the potential for liability. We'll tell you what to look out for. Next, we'll look at how small firms can decide when to hire new staff. And finally, we'll investigate the rigged world of claw machines and why it's so hard to grab that stuffed animal. So stay tuned to get the scoop! </p>

<p>First, from <i>news.bloombergtax.com</i>: <a href="https://news.bloombergtax.com/tax-insights-and-commentary/big-four-auditors-and-consultants-need-liability-and-a-divorce" target="_blank">Big Four Auditors and Consultants Need Liability—And a Divorce</a></br>The Big Four accounting firms, such as KPMG, are facing scrutiny as a result of their audit opinions in the recent collapses of Silicon Valley Bank, First Republic Bank and Signature Bank. While the exact cause of the collapses is still undetermined, the potential liability of the accounting firms cannot be ignored. There is a need for liability to be placed on the firms when they fail to identify potential financial issues, as well as a need to increase transparency and decrease the amount of overlap between consulting and auditing roles. There is also a call for the Big Four to return their fees to the banks in order to make depositors whole.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.agileattorney.com</i>: <a href="https://www.agileattorney.com/small-firms-when-to-hire-new-staff/" target="_blank">Small Firms, When to Hire New Staff? </a></br>Small firms are often faced with the difficult decision of when to hire new staff. There are several considerations that must be taken into account, such as the number of open cases, arrival and departure rates, and throughput speed of the firm. It is important to analyze data to make informed decisions and to increase profitability. Additionally, the intake of cases can be throttled to reduce the feeling of overburden.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.vox.com</i>: <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/4/3/8339999/claw-machines-rigged" target="_blank">Claw machines are rigged — here's why it's so hard to grab that stuffed animal </a></br>Claw machines have long been a popular game at arcades and grocery stores, but they are actually rigged to make it difficult to win. Machine owners can fine-tune the strength of the claw and even select a desired level of profit. Many people continue to be tempted by the claw despite its rigging, as social media has made it easy to record successful attempts and create an alluring image of victory. However, the only sure way to win is not to play.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's April 4th, 2023.</p>

<p>We start with Donald Trump, who is facing criminal charges in New York related to the 2016 presidential campaign. Then we move on to Wisconsin, where the Supreme Court election is heating up with estimated spending on TV ads reaching over seven million dollars. Lastly, Twitter is making waves as they move away from their legacy verification system, taking away the checkmark of one high profile account in the process.  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/02/briefing/donald-trump-indictment-arrest.html" target="_blank">Maggie Haberman on Donald Trump </a></br>This week, former President Donald Trump is expected to fly to New York to face criminal charges related to the payment of hush money during the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump and his aides were reportedly surprised by the news and are still in the process of assessing the legal, political and emotional implications of the indictment. In addition to the New York case, Trump is also facing investigations into his actions in Georgia, his involvement in the Jan. 6 attack and his handling of classified documents. Trump has attempted to avoid criminal charges since the 1970s and has been protected throughout his presidency. However, despite the indictment, his team believes he has received a political boost and is leading against Ron DeSantis in primary polls.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.brennancenter.org</i>: <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/buying-time-2023-wisconsin" target="_blank">Buying Time 2023 – Wisconsin </a></br>This Wisconsin Supreme Court election will feature four candidates: Waukesha County Circuit Court Judge Jennifer Dorow, former Wisconsin Supreme Court justice Daniel Kelly, Dane County Circuit Court Judge Everett Mitchell, and Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Janet Protasiewicz. The two candidates who received the most votes in the primary election, Janet Protasiewicz and Dan Kelly, will compete in the nonpartisan general election on April 4, 2023. Kantar Media/CMAG reported that the orders for political ads totaled $28,837,702. Estimated spending for TV ads was reported as $7,357,090. Advertisements from various candidates and outside groups can be seen across broadcast and cable television, satellite television, and radio.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.theverge.com</i>: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/3/23667751/twitter-legacy-blue-checkmark-wind-down-chaos" target="_blank">Twitter yanks the New York Times’ checkmark in verification overhaul </a></br>Twitter had a chaotic weekend as it began to wind down its legacy verified checkmark program. The process appears to be subject to the whims of its CEO, Elon Musk, and the platform has stopped officially distinguishing between legacy verified users and accounts that pay for Twitter Blue. Musk has said that legacy verified accounts will be given a few weeks grace before their checkmarks are removed, however one high-profile example of a previously verified account has already lost its legacy verified badge. The move to aggressively push paid verification has reportedly caused Twitter's value to be less than half what Musk paid for it less than a year ago.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4283290" target="_blank">The Constitutional Limits of Criminal Supervision</a> by Eric S. Fish. This paper discusses how criminal supervision can be made compatible with the Sixth Amendment and proposes a new solution to this constitutional puzzle: the conditional sentencing theory. This theory explains how a criminal sentence can include provisions that change the defendant’s custody status if certain conditions are satisfied and places two important constitutional limits on criminal supervision. These limits state that a judge cannot retroactively change a supervision sentence and that a sentence for a supervision violation cannot exceed the statutory maximum for the underlying crime. The paper argues that judges should direct greater constitutional scrutiny at institutions, like criminal supervision, that make incarceration more efficient by circumventing defendants’ rights.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's April 3rd, 2023.</p>

<p>Greetings, everyone! It's Max here with your top news stories of the day. We'll start off with Andreessen Horowitz and their move to court capital from Saudi Arabia, despite the U.S. strains. Then, we'll take a look at the wrongfully arrested Randal Quran Reid and how Clearview AI technology led to his arrest. Finally, we'll discuss the backlash Feedly is facing over its AI-powered protest-tracking models. It's sure to be an interesting day in tech news, so stay tuned! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>techcrunch.com</i>: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/01/andreessen-horowitz-is-now-openly-courting-capital-from-saudi-arabia-despite-u-s-strains/" target="_blank">Andreessen Horowitz is now openly courting capital from Saudi Arabia, despite U.S. strains </a></br>Andreessen Horowitz, one of the world's biggest venture firms, has recently courted capital from Saudi Arabia despite the U.S. strains. The firm's co-founders, Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, appeared on stage at a conference organized by a nonprofit backed by one of Saudi Arabia's largest sovereign funds. They praised Saudi Arabia as a "startup country" and talked about their $350 million investment in Flow, a real estate company founded by Adam Neumann. Meanwhile, U.S. businesses are continuing to conduct business in the region, and venture firms are turning a blind eye to any ties to it.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/31/technology/facial-recognition-false-arrests.html" target="_blank">‘Thousands of Dollars for Something I Didn’t Do’</a></br>Randal Quran Reid was wrongfully arrested and spent six days in jail after a police officer mistook him for a suspect from Louisiana. It turns out that the arrest was the result of a bad facial recognition match from a technology called Clearview AI, which is used by law enforcement agencies. After his release, Mr. Reid's family hired lawyers and spent thousands of dollars to figure out why he was arrested in the first place. Clearview's CEO has since commented that an arrest should not be based solely on a facial recognition search.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.pcmag.com</i>: <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/feedly-faces-backlash-over-protest-tracking-ai-models" target="_blank">Feedly Faces Backlash Over Protest-Tracking AI Models </a></br>Feedly, an RSS reader, is under fire after introducing an AI-powered tool that sparked controversy over potential corporate use of technology to suppress employee-sponsored protests. The company clarified that the tool was intended to help keep people safe in dangerous situations and to alert security analysts about potential risks to a company's assets and employees. The company apologized for the misunderstanding and promised to better communicate its intentions in the future.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4368598" target="_blank">Culpability in Atrocity and the Role of Complicit Observer</a> by Haley S. Anderson. This paper explores Randle DeFalco's book "Invisible Atrocities: The Aesthetic Biases of International Criminal Law," which argues that atrocity crimes are associated with an aesthetic of horrific spectacle. Anderson proposes an additional dimension of the atrocity aesthetic: culpability as imagined by the observer. Anderson suggests that our imaginations provide indicia of culpability by filling in the blank spaces in an image, and by doing so, we make ourselves complicit in the atrocity. Anderson argues that it is the sense of our complicity being intolerable that distinguishes the atrocity aesthetic from mere tragedies.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's April 2nd, 2023.</p>

<p>Today, we take a look at a young girl's bond with her pet goat, a court case about insider trading, and the implications of another potential Trump presidency.  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.latimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-03-30/goat-slaughter-shasta-county-fair" target="_blank">Girl didn't want goat slaughtered; officials sent deputies - Los Angeles Times</a></br>A 9-year-old girl in California was bonded with her goat, Cedar, which she was due to have sold and slaughtered at the Shasta District Fair. When the time came, the girl couldn't go through with it and the mother decided to take the goat and deal with the consequences. After the family moved the goat to a farm in Sonoma County, the Shasta County Sheriff's Office got involved and sent detectives with a search warrant to recover the goat. Despite the mother's offer to pay for the goat, the animal was taken and slaughtered. The family has since filed a federal lawsuit against Shasta District Fair and county officials, arguing they committed an "egregious waste of police resources" and violated their rights.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>lawprofessors.typepad.com</i>: <a href="https://lawprofessors.typepad.com/business_law/2023/04/section-16b-is-unconstitutional-apparently.html" target="_blank">Section 16(b) is Unconstitutional, Apparently</a></br>A Magistrate Judge recently dismissed a claim for disgorgement of short-swing profits against a 10% beneficial owner of 1-800 Flowers, on the grounds that the plaintiffs lacked Article III standing. Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, which was enacted in 1934 to prevent insider trading, provides that any profit realized by an insider from any purchase and sale within a period of less than six months should inure to the issuer. Judge Wicks held that the mere fact that an insider earns short-swing profits does not demonstrate that there was an injury to the corporation, and therefore no Section 16(b) action may be maintained, either by the issuer itself or derivatively by its shareholders. The court allowed for the possibility that some kind of injury might be associated with such profits in a particular case, but held that such an injury must be alleged and proven. The decision is currently on appeal.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.newyorker.com</i>: <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/a-biden-ally-on-the-post-indictment-stakes-of-another-trump-presidency" target="_blank">A Biden Ally on the Post-Indictment Stakes of Another Trump Presidency</a></br>Presidential historian Jon Meacham spoke with Radio Hour this week about the potential rise of Donald Trump in the 2024 election, and his own decision to decline a formal role in the Biden Administration. Meacham discussed the stakes of this latest chapter in the Trump saga and the need to confront the impulse of authoritarianism in the country. He also discussed the Republican "Brigadoon" fantasy that Trump would fade away without any factual basis for that wish, as well as the root of Trumpism and past moments of regrettable behavior from both the Republican and Democratic parties.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4367646" target="_blank">Bail at the Founding</a> by Kellen Funk and Sandra G. Mayson. This paper provides a thorough account of bail law and practice in the founding era, from approximately 1790 to 1810. It reveals three key facts: 1) the black-letter law of bail during the founding era was highly protective of pretrial liberty, 2) in reality, for those on the margins of society, bail practice rarely followed the law, and 3) the bail system in the founding era was a system of unsecured pledges, not cash deposits.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's April 1st, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome back to today's headlines! This is Max reporting in. Amazon is suing sellers for issuing false copyright complaints against competitors, a survey of past criminal prosecutions for covert payments to benefit political campaigns, and an investor predicts AI will 'free humanity' from work. These stories and more, coming up next! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.theverge.com</i>: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/30/23663339/amazon-sues-sellers-copyright-takedown-competitors" target="_blank">Amazon sues sellers for issuing bogus takedown requests on competitors </a></br>Amazon has filed three lawsuits against sellers for allegedly abusing the company's takedown system by issuing bogus copyright complaints against competitors in order to drive sales to their own products. The complaint claims that the sellers created fake, disposable websites with images scraped from the Amazon store and attempted to use them as evidence that they owned the copyright. Amazon also alleges that one defendant fraudulently obtained access to the Brand Registry program, and that another was sanctioned by the US Patent and Trademark Office for filing thousands of false trademark applications.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.justsecurity.org</i>: <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/85745/survey-of-prosecutions-for-covert-payments-to-benefit-campaigns/" target="_blank">Survey of Past Criminal Prosecutions for Covert Payments to Benefit a Political Campaign</a></br>This article provides a timeline of news articles and policy alerts from the past year related to US foreign policy, human rights, and international law. It covers topics such as US support for the International Criminal Court, US-Iran nuclear negotiations, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the January 6th Capitol Hill riots. It also includes expert Q&As, surveys, and letters to the editor to provide a comprehensive look at the current state of US foreign policy.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.businessinsider.com</i>: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-investor-predicts-ai-will-free-humanity-from-work-2023-3" target="_blank">ChatGPT Investor Predicts AI Will 'Free Humanity' From Work</a></br>Vinod Khosla, an early investor in OpenAI, predicts that AI could one day "free humanity from work." Khosla warned, however, that the technology is likely to create major disruption and global competition. He estimated that 80% of jobs could be completed by AI in 25 years and said that transitioning to this new model will not be seamless. Goldman Sachs researchers also estimated that 300 million full-time jobs across the globe could be disrupted by AI. Khosla said that more research is needed to aid in the advancement of AI, as countries such as China have started to invest heavily in it.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4283290" target="_blank">The Constitutional Limits of Criminal Supervision</a> by Eric S. Fish. This article proposes a new solution to the constitutional puzzle of criminal supervision, where a judge can send someone to prison based on facts not proven to a jury. The solution is a conditional sentencing theory, which puts two important constitutional limits on criminal supervision. These limits are that a judge cannot retroactively change a supervision sentence and that a sentence for a supervision violation cannot exceed the statutory maximum for the underlying crime.</p>

<p>It's March 31st, 2023.</p>

<p>First, Donald Trump has been indicted by a Manhattan district attorney for his role in paying hush money during the 2016 election. Then, a Texas federal judge has ordered an end to many Affordable Care Act preventative care coverage requirements. Finally, a secret agreement between Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy reveals how two gay rights cases were decided in 2017, and what this could mean for a current Supreme Court case.  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/03/30/nyregion/trump-indictment-news" target="_blank">Trump Indicted by Grand Jury in New York: Live Updates</a></br>Donald J. Trump was indicted by a Manhattan district attorney on Thursday for his role in paying hush money to porn star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 campaign. The former president has denied any wrongdoing and calls the case "political persecution and election interference at the highest level in history." The prosecution is based on a tawdry episode that preceded his presidency, and the indictment shakes up the 2024 presidential race and marks Trump as the first U.S. president to ever face criminal charges.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.lawdork.com</i>: <a href="https://www.lawdork.com/p/judge-reed-oconnor-aca-prep-cancer-screenings" target="_blank">Judge orders end to PrEP, cancer screenings, other ACA coverage requirements</a></br>In a major decision regarding the Affordable Care Act, a conservative Texas federal judge has ordered an end to many ACA preventative care coverage requirements, including PrEP and cancer screenings. The judge ruled that the US Preventative Services Task Force, which is responsible for such coverage, is appointed in violation of the Appointments Clause and thus, its recommendations cannot be used to create preventative care coverage requirements under the ACA. Contraceptive care requirements remain, however, as the court rejected Appointments Clause challenges to the two other entities responsible for such coverage.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.cnn.com</i>: <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/30/politics/supreme-court-roberts-kennedy-gay-rights-masterpiece-cakeshop/index.html" target="_blank">Supreme Court gay rights: A secret deal between John Roberts and Anthony Kennedy and what it means today </a></br>This article explores the background of two gay rights cases from 2017 and the role Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy played in them. Roberts and Kennedy reached a private agreement that resulted in a ruling in favor of same-sex couples in the case of Pavan v. Smith, while Kennedy voted to hear an appeal from the owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop in Colorado, who had been sanctioned for refusing to bake a wedding cake for two gay men. This pact ensured that a testy draft from Justice Samuel Alito regarding the Masterpiece Cakeshop petition never became public. The article also looks ahead to the current Supreme Court case regarding the free-speech rights of business operators who cite religious objections when refusing to serve same-sex couples.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4266445" target="_blank">Red Courts, Blue Courts</a> authored by Mark A. Lemley. This paper investigates the increasing divide in the federal judiciary between red and blue courts, with Democratic presidents appointing judges in blue states and Republicans appointing judges in red states. It discusses the danger this phenomenon poses to the rule of law and offers potential solutions.</p>

<p>It's March 30th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to the news roundup! Today we're looking at stories from around the country. From Washington, DC, we have a story about Ginni Thomas and her conservative activist group, which received nearly $600,000 in anonymous donations. Next, in Idaho, we look at a new bill that seeks to limit interstate travel for abortion care. And finally, in Virginia, Governor Glenn Youngkin has revived a lifetime ban on voting for felons. Stay tuned for all the details! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.washingtonpost.com</i>: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2023/03/28/ginni-thomas-crowdsourcers-anonymous-donations/" target="_blank">Ginni Thomas's group Crowdsourcers got nearly $600,000 in anonymous donations </a></br>Ginni Thomas, wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, led a conservative activist group called Crowdsourcers for Culture and Liberty which received nearly $600,000 in anonymous donations over three years. The donations were channeled through a right-wing think tank in Washington, shielding the organization from disclosing its activities and spending. This new light on the funding and activities of Ginni Thomas’s political advocacy raises questions about potential conflicts of interest for her husband.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.huffpost.com</i>: <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/idaho-abortion-bill-trafficking-travel_n_641b62c3e4b00c3e6077c80b" target="_blank">Idaho Bill Would Restrict Interstate Travel For Abortion</a></br>Idaho is about to become the first state to restrict interstate travel for abortion with a new bill that would create a crime called "abortion trafficking" as a felony offense. The bill seeks to limit minors' ability to travel for abortion care without parental consent, and those found guilty of the crime would face two to five years in prison. Republican lawmakers have said that the intent of the legislation is to limit minors from traveling out of state for an abortion, as nearly all abortions are illegal in Idaho. The bill has rapidly advanced through the Legislature and is likely to pass, with Governor Brad Little expected to sign it into law.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>boltsmag.org</i>: <a href="https://boltsmag.org/virginia-governor-youngkin-rights-restoration/" target="_blank">“Back to 1902”: Virginia Governor Revives Lifetime Ban on Voting</a></br>Governor Glenn Youngkin of Virginia has rescinded his predecessors' policy to automatically restore the voting rights of people with felony convictions, now requiring people to apply for their rights to be restored on an individual basis. This decision will sideline many Virginians who had expected to regain the right to vote, and puts Virginia in the company of Iowa and Kentucky as the only states with a lifetime ban on voting for all felonies, with no remedy other than clemency from the governor. Now, hundreds of thousands of Virginians who had their rights restored previously are without a say in Virginia elections, while the future of the reforms implemented by the past governors is uncertain.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1769270" target="_blank">Rescuing the Invention from the Cult of the Claim,</a> written by Oskar Liivak. This article argues that modern patent law fails to take into account the concept of invention, and that the current system is not as precise or stable as it should be. Liivak suggests that invention should be seen as a substantive concept and that claims should be used as tools to administer the patent system.</p>

<p>It's March 29th, 2023.</p>

<p>Today, we're looking at three stories that really stand out. First, Twitter reportedly has a secret VIP list: celebrities and politicians who get boosted over everyone else. Then, a federal judge in Texas declined to grant relief to students at West Texas A&M University after their charity drag show was banned due to the president's personal opposition. Finally, Republicans are proposing a bill to protect Donald Trump from possible prosecution.  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.platformer.news</i>: <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/the-secret-list-of-twitter-vips-getting" target="_blank">The secret list of Twitter VIPs getting boosted over everyone else</a></br>This article reports that Twitter has a list of VIP users, including celebrities and politicians, whose accounts it monitors and offers increased visibility. Despite CEO Elon Musk's claims that everyone should be treated equally, Twitter reportedly maintains this list. It comes after the company began notifying verified users that they need to pay $8 a month to keep their blue check marks.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.lawdork.com</i>: <a href="https://www.lawdork.com/p/kacsmaryk-drag-wtamu-ex-parte-tro-denied" target="_blank">Texas judge: No immediate relief for students facing drag show ban</a></br>A federal judge in Texas has ruled against granting immediate relief to students at West Texas A&M University who were facing a ban on a charity drag show. U.S District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk refused the student group's request for an ex parte temporary restraining order, citing procedural rules and without providing further explanation. The university's president had banned the event due to his personal opposition to the show, despite the fact that existing policies at the school allowed for it.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.msnbc.com</i>: <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/gop-eyes-possible-legislation-shield-trump-prosecution-rcna76770" target="_blank">GOP eyes possible legislation to shield Trump from prosecution</a></br>House Republicans have proposed a bill to protect current and former presidents from "politically motivated prosecutions" in response to the New York District Attorney's investigation into former President Donald Trump. Three committee chairs - Jim Jordan of Ohio, James Comer of Kentucky, and Bryan Steil of Wisconsin - have written to District Attorney Alvin Bragg seeking his congressional testimony, but have been rebuked by Bragg's office. Democrats, such as Rep. Daniel Goldman of New York, have called the proposed bill the Protect Donald Trump Act and indicated that it won't become law so long as Democrats are in power.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4368598" target="_blank">Culpability in Atrocity and the Role of Complicit Observer</a> written by Haley S. Anderson. This paper explores culpability as an important part of atrocity crimes, which are commonly associated with an "aesthetic of horrific spectacle" that is "intuitively recognizable." Anderson proposes an alternate account of culpability's role in the atrocity aesthetic, where our imaginations provide indicia of culpability by filling in the blank spaces in an image. This feeling of complicity can evoke various reactions, and it is the sense of our complicity being intolerable that distinguishes the atrocity aesthetic from mere tragedies.</p>

<p>It's March 28th, 2023.</p>

<p>Greetings, citizens of the world! It's Max, keeping you up to date with the latest news. Today we're taking a look at the FBI's purchase of data from an internet company, a controversial decision to ban a movie from Pinellas County schools, and a new bill from Senator Mark Warner.  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.vice.com</i>: <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy3z9a/fbi-bought-netflow-data-team-cymru-contract" target="_blank">Here is the FBI’s Contract to Buy Mass Internet Data</a></br>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) recently purchased access to "netflow" data from Team Cymru, a company that obtains this data from ISPs. This data provides a picture of traffic volume and flow across a network and can be used to identify infrastructure used by hackers. The purchase, which was made for the FBI's Cyber Division, is part of an often overlooked trade of internet data. Senator Ron Wyden has asked the Department of Justice Inspector General to investigate the FBI's purchase of this data.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.tampabay.com</i>: <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/education/2023/03/27/removal-ruby-bridges-film-pinellas-school-sparks-outrage/" target="_blank">Removal of ‘Ruby Bridges’ film from Pinellas school sparks outrage</a></br>A parent has complained that the Disney movie "Ruby Bridges," which tells the story of a 6-year-old who integrated New Orleans schools in the 1960s, is teaching their child that white people hate Black people. As a result, the Pinellas County school district has banned the movie from North Shore Elementary, raising questions about the district's leadership and the fairness of their decision-making. District officials cite state law, which some have called vague, as the reason for banning the movie and other materials with controversial content. Other countywide groups have spoken out against the decision, calling for the district to look more closely at their policies and the potential consequences of their decisions.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.govtrack.us</i>: <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s790?utm_campaign=govtrack_email_update&utm_source=govtrack/email_update&utm_medium=email" target="_blank">A bill to align executive compensation with sustainable value creation, and for other purposes. (S. 790) </a></br>A new bill, S. 790, has been introduced by Senator Mark Warner of Virginia to align executive compensation with sustainable value creation. The bill has been referred to committee and currently has two co-sponsors, both Democrats. If passed, it would become law and require executive compensation to be tied to sustainable value creation.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4396826" target="_blank">Climate Services: The Business of Physical Risk</a> by Madison Condon. It is a discussion of the limited and expensive access to climate risk information available to individuals and municipalities, and the need for state and federal governments to invest in their own climate services capacity.

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's March 27th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's news roundup! We have three stories to share today. First, we look at the difference between delay and obstruction in President Trump's attempts to impede criminal investigations. Second, we take a look at the troubling pattern of decreasing life expectancy in the US, and what can be done to turn it around. Finally, we hear from DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis on the potential of AI and the need for caution when developing and releasing these technologies. So stay tuned for more. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>terikanefield.com</i>: <a href="https://terikanefield.com/trump-is-not-trying-to-delay-he-is-trying-to-obstruct-and-destroy/" target="_blank">It's not about delay. It's about obstruction and destruction. </a></br>This article explores the difference between delay and obstruction as it relates to President Trump's attempts to delay or derail criminal investigations into his activities. The author argues that Trump is attempting to completely derail the investigations, rather than merely delay them, and explores this idea by looking at one of Trump's legal attempts to do so.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.npr.org</i>: <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/03/25/1164819944/live-free-and-die-the-sad-state-of-u-s-life-expectancy" target="_blank">Scientists warned a decade ago American lives were shortening. Then it got worse </a></br>The US has seen a troubling pattern of shorter life expectancy and increasing mortality rates in recent years, with the US now having a lower life expectancy than Cuba, Lebanon, and Czechia. Ten years ago, a landmark report documented the US's health disadvantage relative to other developed countries, but the findings failed to spark significant action. The report highlighted poor diets, sedentary lifestyles, poverty, racial segregation, and more as factors in the population's poor health. It's not too late to turn this trend around, but to do so will require a holistic approach to addressing the multiple issues contributing to the US's health disadvantage.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>time.com</i>: <a href="https://time.com/6246119/demis-hassabis-deepmind-interview/" target="_blank">DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis Urges Caution on AI</a></br>Demis Hassabis, CEO and co-founder of DeepMind, discusses his ambitious plans for AI, from AlphaFold to nuclear fusion. He also warns of the potential dangers of AI, urging others to move cautiously and think of the implications before releasing their technologies into the world. He believes that AI could become a powerful force for good, but that it could also be misused and cause harm, and that it is up to researchers to make sure this does not happen.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4396819" target="_blank">What's Scope 3 Good For?</a> by Madison Condon. This article discusses how Scope 3 data is collected and used in practice, and how it is a metric for financial risk and corporate governance. It outlines critiques and qualifications of the uses of Scope 3 data, and how U.S. financial regulators can improve upon the early approaches of other jurisdictions.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's March 26th, 2023.</p>

<p>Greetings, friends! It's time for the news of the day. We have a court ruling that's a major blow to libraries across the US, a potential textpocalypse brought about by AI technology, and a controversial Oklahoma abortion ban. It's a lot to take in, so stay tuned for more on these stories. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>blog.archive.org</i>: <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2023/03/25/the-fight-continues/" target="_blank">The Fight Continues </a></br>A recent court ruling has been a major blow to libraries and the communities they serve. The ruling affects libraries across the US who rely on controlled digital lending to connect their patrons with books online. In response, Internet Archive is appealing the judgment and encouraging the community to stand up for libraries and the digital rights of all libraries. Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle has stated that libraries are essential to democracy and must be allowed to own, lend, and preserve books. The organization will continue its work as a library, providing services such as interlibrary loan, citation linking, access for the print-disabled, and more.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.theatlantic.com</i>: <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/03/ai-chatgpt-writing-language-models/673318/" target="_blank">AI Is Ushering in a Textpocalypse </a></br>The emerging technology of generative AI has the potential to bring about a "textpocalypse," flooding the internet with an endless stream of machine-generated content. This would be amplified by the use of AI-driven programs like ChatGPT, and could lead to a world where human written text is overshadowed by AI-generated prose. This could lead to the spread of disinformation, and a disruption of the read-write web, where humans both consume and produce content.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>slate.com</i>: <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/03/oklahoma-abortion-ban-judges-dissents-say-pregnant-women-have-no-right-to-life.html" target="_blank">Oklahoma abortion ban: Judges’ dissents say pregnant women have no right to life.</a></br>This article examines a recent ruling by the Oklahoma Supreme Court which requires the state's near-total abortion ban to include an exception for cases in which there is a reasonable medical certainty that a pregnancy would endanger a patient's life. Four Republican-appointed justices dissented from the ruling, suggesting that pregnant people should not have the right to lifesaving abortions, and that it should be up to the people or their legislative representatives to decide. The article argues that the right to not die of a preventable pregnancy-related illness or infection could be found in any number of places in the Oklahoma Constitution, and that allowing women to die to preserve the potential life of a fetus is a grave injustice.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1857536" target="_blank">The Problem with Privacy</a> by Lilian Edwards. This paper critiques the European regime of mandatory data protection laws, suggests a 'privacy tax' be levied on data collectors and processors, and proposes a no-fault compensation system for identified "privacy harms".</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's March 25th, 2023.</p>

<p>This is Max, here to give you the headlines from today's top stories. First, from Florida, we have the story of a principal's firing after an art teacher showed a picture of Michelangelo's David in class. In Washington, DC, a federal judge has ordered former President Donald Trump's aides to testify in a probe into the Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol. And finally, we'll look at the debate in Congress over banning the popular app TikTok.  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>slate.com</i>: <a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/03/florida-principal-fired-michelangelo-david-statue.html" target="_blank">Florida principal fired: Interview with the school board chair who ousted a principal after Michelangelo’s David was shown in class.</a></br>The Tallahassee Classical School board chair Barney Bishop III forced out the school's principal after three parents complained about an art teacher showing a picture of Michelangelo's 16th-century sculpture of David. Bishop discussed why the board made this decision, saying it was based on a range of issues, not just the statue. He also emphasized the school's mission of teaching moral and civic values through a classical education, which includes the teaching of Renaissance art.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>abcnews.go.com</i>: <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/meadows-top-trump-aides-ordered-testify-jan-6/story?id=98101813" target="_blank">Meadows, other top Trump aides ordered to testify in Jan. 6 probe as judge rejects claims of executive privilege </a></br>A federal judge has rejected former President Donald Trump's claims of executive privilege and has ordered Mark Meadows and other former top aides to testify before a federal grand jury investigating Trump's efforts to overturn the election leading up to the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Judge Beryl Howell rejected Trump's claim of executive privilege for Meadows and a number of others, including Trump's former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, his former national security adviser Robert O'Brien, former top aide Stephen Miller, and former deputy chief of staff and social media director Dan Scavino. Trump is likely to appeal the ruling.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.schneier.com</i>: <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2023/02/banning-tiktok.html" target="_blank">Banning TikTok </a></br>Congress is debating bills that would ban TikTok in the United States, but technologists are warning that this would be a terrible idea and would have severe side effects. Such a ban would be ineffective and would force the US to adopt Chinese censorship technology. Furthermore, enacting such a ban would raise constitutional issues, as it would limit Americans' access to the Internet. Instead, Congress should focus on enacting serious privacy laws that would protect US citizens from data collection, analysis, and sale.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4380829" target="_blank">Election Subversion and the Writ of Mandamus</a> by Derek T. Muller. The article explores the value of the writ of mandamus in election disputes and suggests ways for states to strengthen the law around it to ensure that election administration occurs in a timely and effective manner. It argues that mandamus is uniquely situated to help courts prevent election subversion, and discusses both federal and state laws that delineate clear and mandatory responsibilities for election officials after votes have been cast in an election.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's March 24th, 2023.</p>

<p>Hey there, Max here! Need a break from your day? Well, you've come to the right place! I've got some news stories for you today that will surely keep your mind entertained. First, the Supreme Court is debating whether a Jack Daniel's-inspired dog toy is protected by the First Amendment. Then, a lawyer's advice on how to be proactive instead of reactive in customer service. Finally, Cory Doctorow is kickstarting an audiobook of his upcoming novel, and it's a post-cyberpunk anti-finance finance thriller!  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/22/us/politics/jack-daniels-dog-toy-supreme-court.html" target="_blank">Jack Daniel’s-Inspired Dog Toy Provokes Supreme Court Debate </a></br>The Supreme Court heard arguments on Wednesday concerning a trademark case involving a chew toy for dogs made by Bad Spaniels that resembles a bottle of Jack Daniel's whiskey. The toy has humorous references to the liquor, such as replacing "40 percent alcohol by volume" with "43 percent poo", and the justices discussed whether the public was likely to be confused about the product's source or whether it was protected by the First Amendment. Ultimately, the court was divided on the issue.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.agileattorney.com</i>: <a href="https://www.agileattorney.com/proactive-beats-responsive/" target="_blank">Proactive beats Responsive </a></br>In this article, the writer expresses the opinion that lawyers should be proactive instead of reactive when it comes to customer service. He suggests that lawyers should have a communication schedule with their clients, such as providing an update on their case weekly or monthly. This proactive approach can help create a better customer experience and help prevent bar complaints. </p>

<p>Finally, from <i>pluralistic.net</i>: <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/22/anti-finance-finance-thriller/" target="_blank">Pluralistic: Kickstarting the Red Team Blues audiobook, which Amazon won’t sell (21 Mar 2023) </a></br>The author Cory Doctorow is launching a Kickstarter to fund an audiobook of his upcoming novel "Red Team Blues." The audiobook will be narrated by Wil Wheaton and is a post-cyberpunk anti-finance finance thriller. Audible, Amazon's monopoly audiobook platform, has refused to sell the audiobook due to its lack of DRM protection. Doctorow is hoping that a successful Kickstarter campaign will show other authors that it is possible to bypass Amazon's monopoly and make audiobooks available without DRM.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1823396" target="_blank">Running the Gamut from A to B: Federal Trademark and False Advertising Law</a> by Rebecca Tushnet. This paper examines how courts interpret the Lanham Act which bars trademark infringement and false advertising. It argues that courts should rationalize their treatment of implied claims, impose a materiality requirement, and recognize that competitors have sufficient interests to confer standing. The paper seeks to promote the interests of smaller companies against the most powerful companies.</p>

<p>Former President Donald Trump is opposing a ruling that his attorney must testify in a grand jury investigation. The Supreme Court heard arguments in the case of Jack Daniel's Properties, Inc. v. VIP Products LLC. And Harvard, NYU, and the University of Pennsylvania are co-hosting the Trademark and Unfair Competition Scholarship Roundtable this October. Stick around for all the details on these stories, coming up next. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.politico.com</i>: <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/03/21/trump-crime-fraud-attorney-documents-probe-00088215" target="_blank">Trump denounces ‘crime-fraud’ ruling forcing attorney to testify in documents probe </a></br>Former President Donald Trump is fighting a federal judge’s determination that his communications with attorney Evan Corcoran, amid a grand jury probe of Trump’s handling of classified documents, likely contain evidence of a crime. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals temporarily stayed Judge Beryl Howell’s order on Tuesday, ordering an extraordinarily rapid series of filings from both sides. Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign issued a statement Tuesday attacking special counsel Jack Smith and Howell, while the appeals court has asked Trump’s attorneys to specify the precise set of documents at issue by midnight and for Smith’s team to respond by 6 a.m. Wednesday. The parallel submissions were linked to an investigation into the handling of classified documents by Trump and his aides, with proceedings related to the classified-documents grand jury occurring under seal.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.supremecourt.gov</i>: <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/public/22-148.html" target="_blank">Docket for 22-148</a></br>The Supreme Court recently heard arguments in the case of Jack Daniel's Properties, Inc. v. VIP Products LLC. The case involves a dispute over trademark infringement. Numerous amicus briefs were filed in support of either party, as well as amicus briefs from the United States and several other organizations.

The paper discusses the new Personal Data Protection Act in Indonesia, which was passed into law on 20 September 2022. This new law contains 76 articles, including provisions on the types of data under the scope of the Bill, rights of data subjects, data processing by data controllers and processors, and the establishment of a Data Protection Authority. It is one of the best data privacy laws in Asia and is compared to the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

<p>It's March 22nd, 2023.</p>

<p>This is Max with your latest news round-up. Today we're looking at a battle between book publishers and the Internet Archive over copyright infringement, Stanford's risky and costly AI model, and the implications of the Silicon Valley Bank collapse.

<p>First, from <i>arstechnica.com</i>: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/03/book-publishers-with-surging-profits-struggle-to-prove-internet-archive-hurt-sales/" target="_blank">Book publishers with surging profits struggle to prove Internet Archive hurt sales </a></br>Today in court, Internet Archive defended its practice of digitizing books and lending those e-books for free to its Open Library users. Four of the wealthiest book publishers allege this kind of digital lending is copyright infringement, but IA's lawyer argues it is fair use and they have yet to show they've been harmed by IA's lending. It is now up to a federal judge, John Koeltl, to decide if IA's digital lending constitutes copyright infringement or not. Both sides presented arguments and Koeltl's questioning of both sides suggested this is a complicated decision to make.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.theregister.com</i>: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/21/stanford_ai_alpaca_taken_offline/" target="_blank">Stanford takes costly, risky Alpaca AI model offline </a></br>A new AI language model called Alpaca has been released by Stanford researchers, however the online demo of the model has been taken down due to safety and cost concerns. Alpaca was an open-source, seven-billion-parameter model that cost less than $600 to build and was designed to be more like OpenAI's text-davinci-003 model. The code and dataset for Alpaca remain available on GitHub, but the model is prone to generating misinformation and offensive text due to its instruction-following capabilities.</p>

It highlights the need for better regulation, culture, and supervision to prevent future financial crises, as well as the role of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's chair in warning of the risk.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3637204" target="_blank">The Separation of Voting and Control: The Role of Contract in Corporate Governance</a> by Gabriel V. Rauterberg. This paper examines the phenomenon of shareholder agreements, contracts among the owners of a firm, and their role in public and private companies. It shows that 15% of corporations that go public in recent years do so subject to a shareholder agreement. These agreements are used to bargain for control rights such as vetoes over major corporate actions, restrict the sale of shares, and waive aspects of the duty of loyalty. The author also offers preliminary views on the welfare effects, implications for corporate theory, and governing law of shareholder agreements.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's March 21st, 2023.</p>

<p>Hey there, Max here! The US Supreme Court is being asked to decide if Artificial Intelligence can be a patent inventor. Then, in New York, citizens are calling on their legislators to fully fund a public campaign financing system. And finally, a look at how the anti-abortion movement is using a tactic of claiming to speak for the voiceless unborn to restrict the rights of living, breathing humans.  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.reuters.com</i>: <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-supreme-court-asked-decide-if-ai-can-be-patent-inventor-2023-03-17/" target="_blank">U.S. Supreme Court asked to decide if AI can be a patent 'inventor' </a></br>Computer scientist Stephen Thaler has petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to review a decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that AI-generated inventions cannot be patented since the law requires inventors to be human beings. Thaler believes that AI is being used to innovate in various areas, and that rejecting AI-generated patents limits the patent system's ability to stimulate innovation. He has also filed for copyright protection for AI-generated art and applied for DABUS patents in other countries.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>secure.brennancenter.org</i>: <a href="https://secure.brennancenter.org/secure/tell-new-york-lawmakers-fund-small-donor-public-financing-now-0" target="_blank">Tell New York Lawmakers: Fund Small Donor Public Financing Now </a></br>New Yorkers won a victory for democracy three years ago when state leaders passed a public campaign financing system, however state legislators have not taken the necessary steps to get the program off the ground. On April 1st, New Yorkers are asking their legislators to fully fund the program in the final budget so that it can be ready to go in the 2024 election.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>slate.com</i>: <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/03/we-are-all-fetuses-now.html" target="_blank">Abortion, trans legislation, book banning: We are all fetuses now.</a></br>This article discusses the anti-abortion movement's tactic of claiming to speak for the voiceless unborn, which has now been deployed to deprive actual living, breathing, ambulating humans of agency. Politicians are using this tactic to ban books, silence teachers, and deny health care to families seeking to support trans kids. This has led to a form of illiberalism where we are all expected to remain fetuses forever.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3919884" target="_blank">The Dual Class Spectrum</a> and was written by Jarrod Shobe and Gladriel Shobe. The paper provides a new perspective on the long-standing debate over dual-class companies by showing that treating the distinction between single-class and dual-class as binary has overlooked the ways in which insiders receive rights that are not available to public shareholders. The dataset shows the wide spectrum of control rights that purportedly single-class corporations grant to insider shareholders by contract. This Article argues that single-class companies that grant disproportionate control rights to insider shareholders by contract are single class in form, but dual class in substance, and provides a framework for scholars and policymakers to account for the full complexity of dual-class structures.</p>

<p>It's March 20th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to the world of news, where responsiveness is the death of productivity, the Federal Reserve was aware of Silicon Valley's risky practices, and Austin, Texas is transforming into a turbocharged tech megalopolis.  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.agileattorney.com</i>: <a href="https://www.agileattorney.com/responsiveness-is-the-death-of-productivity/" target="_blank">Responsiveness is the Death of Productivity </a></br>This article discusses how the conventional wisdom of lawyers to be "client responsive" can have a negative effect on quality of service. The author gives an example of his great grandfather, Loyd Wright, who installed a phone in Howard Hughes' bedroom so that Hughes could be reached during the night. The article argues that this kind of responsiveness can lead to increased costs for clients as well as diminished experiences. The author recommends that lawyers learn to say "not yet" and make a commitment to deliver legal work for their clients.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/19/business/economy/fed-silicon-valley-bank.html" target="_blank">Before Collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, the Fed Spotted Big Problems </a></br>The Federal Reserve was aware of Silicon Valley Bank's risky practices for over a year, issuing six citations in 2021. However, the bank's weaknesses were not resolved and, by early 2023, the Fed found additional deficiencies in their risk management. Ultimately, the bank's March 10th collapse prompted a government intervention and an investigation into what went wrong. The investigation, headed by Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael S. Barr, is expected to be released by May 1st.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.newyorker.com</i>: <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/02/13/the-astonishing-transformation-of-austin" target="_blank">The Astonishing Transformation of Austin</a></br>Austin, Texas, has transformed from a laid-back, weird city to a turbocharged tech megalopolis. The city has seen an influx of exiles from places like Silicon Valley, and its population has ballooned. Despite the city's racial divisions, the physical beauty, joyous music, intellectual scene, and access to nature has much to offer, making it an ideal place to settle. The unofficial motto is still "Keep Austin Weird" alongside "Onward Thru the Fog," reminding residents of the city's colorful past.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1254648" target="_blank">How to Prevent Hard Cases from Making Bad Law: Bear Stearns, Delaware and the Strategic Use of Comity</a> by Marcel Kahan and Edward B. Rock. The paper discusses how Delaware handled the Bear Stearns and JP Morgan Chase merger by finding a third way that avoids both a decision that would undermine the delicate balance between managers and shareholders and a decision that would interfere with the imperatives of national and international economic policy. The authors analyze the issues under Delaware law and discuss the implications of this episode for our understanding of the landscape of US corporate law making.</p>

<p>It's March 19th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome back, citizens! Today we have three stories from around the world. In Tennessee, police stopped a Black couple, took away their five children, and the case has raised questions about racial disparities in child welfare services. Former President Donald Trump is expecting to be indicted by a Manhattan grand jury, and he's calling for protests in response. And finally, there's a story of intrigue behind the 1980 presidential election. An untold story of a mission to the Middle East to sabotage Jimmy Carter's re-election campaign.  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.theguardian.com</i>: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/18/police-stopped-a-couple-in-tennessee-then-they-took-their-children-away" target="_blank">Police stopped a Black couple in Tennessee – and took their children</a></br>This article examines the case of Bianca Clayborne and Deonte Williams, a couple who had their 5 children taken away by state authorities in Tennessee after a highway patrol officer stopped them and discovered a minuscule amount of marijuana in the car. The article discusses how this case fits into a larger history of US child welfare services disproportionately targeting poor, Black and Indigenous families, and the efforts of their attorneys and state lawmakers to help the couple regain custody of their children.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/18/us/politics/trump-indictment-arrest-protests.html?unlocked_article_code=Fb0Krc2Dq4XC5Z8zkGGEulcerOGjA-Jiirq3yQrKU_l9lSF5cPXqoY5B9DvOpm73ZjXwwNqB-H0nKiNLFKADYYDsFdS6nL1ojfGPkJb01FzaQtk2YUE91H8xcLZcKEvKuK1EHLloZFjbIi96PhrlOjZqtDKtD_SGGWD3lmuGGP80-el0uf1WEvbpx0ImDFDWAMKWB6MX4kC5fAXsOGZu-jrjTULVD1sztttvAIStGOnsGYO9OP0MlaMHTTAY61dvd9-nPbcoy0Dnw8B2iGigk1MpdVBvnD0W8J5pMknr5VGiAppMqoxEm8f4MpOx6YcT0MAfXrH0Thod5ufNYVnIG46EtayJ9sdpAhsJiGI8&smid=url-share" target="_blank">Trump Says He Will Be Arrested on Tuesday as Indictment Looms </a></br>Former President Donald J. Trump is expecting to be indicted by a Manhattan grand jury, and he has called for protests in response. The charges are expected to stem from a 2016 hush money payment to a porn star. Mr. Trump’s lawyers have not received a timeline for when the charges will be sought or an arrest made. His post on Saturday urging his supporters to protest and reclaim the nation carried echoes of the incendiary messages he posted online in the weeks before the attack on the US Capitol in 2020. Speaker Kevin McCarthy has called for investigations into whether federal funds are being used for politically motivated prosecutions.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/18/us/politics/jimmy-carter-october-surprise-iran-hostages.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare" target="_blank">An Untold Story Behind Jimmy Carter’s Presidential Defeat</a></br>This story follows the recollections of Ben Barnes, a prominent Texas politician, who claims he was part of a mission to the Middle East in 1980 that sought to sabotage President Jimmy Carter's re-election campaign. The mission was led by John B. Connally Jr., a titan of American politics and former Texas governor, who was determined to help Ronald Reagan beat Mr. Carter and potentially make his own case for a cabinet position in the new administration. Records and news accounts from the time confirm the trip, which Barnes says was done to deliver a message to Iran not to release the hostages before the election. Four living people have confirmed that Barnes shared the story with them over the years.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4207141" target="_blank">The Neglected Origins of the Hearsay Rule in American Slavery: Recovering Queen v. Hepburn</a> and is written by David Alan Sklansky. This article traces the background of the 1813 Supreme Court case, Queen v. Hepburn, which kept a woman and her daughter enslaved by blocking evidence that one of their ancestors had been free. The case transformed the hearsay doctrine from a flexible preference for live testimony into a rigid rule of evidentiary exclusion and helped to keep slaves in bondage. The article discusses why this case should be taught in American law schools to help lawyers understand the full background of the hearsay rule.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's March 18th, 2023.</p>

<p>Today in the news, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for two individuals in relation to the situation in Ukraine, including the President of the Russian Federation. We'll also explore the implications of Section 230 and its protection of generative AI tools, like ChatGPT. And finally, a federal appeals court has left Florida DeSantis' anti-'woke' law blocked in public colleges.  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.icc-cpi.int</i>: <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/situation-ukraine-icc-judges-issue-arrest-warrants-against-vladimir-vladimirovich-putin-and" target="_blank">Situation in Ukraine: ICC judges issue arrest warrants against Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin and Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova </a></br>Today, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for two individuals in relation to the situation in Ukraine. Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, President of the Russian Federation, is charged with war crimes of unlawful deportation of population and unlawful transfer of population from occupied areas of Ukraine to the Russian Federation. Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova, Commissioner for Children’s Rights in the Office of the President of the Russian Federation, is charged with the same war crimes. The arrest warrants were issued after an application from the Prosecution. The existence of the warrants has been authorised for public disclosure.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.techdirt.com</i>: <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/03/17/yes-section-230-should-protect-chatgpt-and-others-generative-ai-tools/" target="_blank">Yes, Section 230 Should Protect ChatGPT And Other Generative AI Tools</a></br>In a new article discussing the application of Section 230 to generative AI products like ChatGPT, technology policy scholar and expert Matt Perault argues that, due to the nature of generative AI, ChatGPT operates as a co-creator and should not be eligible for protection under Section 230. However, Jess Miers presents a counter argument, suggesting that Section 230 should and does protect products like ChatGPT. Miers notes that existing precedent suggests that websites retain immunity when they provide neutral tools to facilitate user expression, citing the Court's ruling in the Roommates case. Miers concludes that a website must do more than simply augmenting, curating, and displaying content (algorithmically or otherwise) to transform into the creator or developer of third-party content in order for Section 230 to not apply.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.cnn.com</i>: <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/17/politics/desantis-anti-woke-law-appeal-block/index.html" target="_blank">Federal appeals court leaves DeSantis' anti-'woke' law blocked in Florida public colleges </a></br>A federal appeals court denied a request from the Florida DeSantis administration to stay an injunction from US District Judge Mark Walker blocking a portion of the state's "Stop Woke Act." The law is intended to prevent teachings or mandatory workplace activities that suggest a person is privileged or oppressed based on their race, color, sex or national origin. Opponents of the law are fighting it on three fronts: the law’s effects on K-12, higher education and employers. The Legal Defense Fund, which represented the plaintiffs in the case, celebrated the decision.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4182521" target="_blank">What Do Law Professors Believe about Law and the Legal Academy?</a> by Eric Martínez and Kevin Tobia. This article presents the first dataset of American law professors' views about legal theory by studying over six hundred law professors. It documents expert consensus and dissensus about dozens of longstanding debates, as well as law professors' evaluation of over one hundred areas of law. The findings from this study provide insight into legal theory, education, and practice.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's March 17th, 2023.</p>

<p>First, we'll be discussing why Larry Summers is so obsessed with tech billionaires and the implications of his decisions. Then, we'll look at the family in Allegheny County that is speaking out against the use of an AI tool that may discriminate against parents with disabilities. Finally, we'll explore design patents and patent litigation as we examine the design patents collected by Sarah Burstein. Stay tuned! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.thenation.com</i>: <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/economy/larry-summers-tech-bros/" target="_blank">Why Is Larry Summers So Obsessed With Tech Bros?</a></br>This article looks at the implications of former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers' calls to bail out Silicon Valley Bank. It raises questions about whether Summers' business partnerships have influenced his decisions and whether he believes the working class should have to face the consequences of their actions but tech moguls should not. The article looks at the recent bank runs at SVB and Silvergate, and Summers' vehement calls for their depositors to be paid back in full, and suggests that Summers' policies indicate he believes only certain classes of people ought to be on the hook for the economic strain.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>apnews.com</i>: <a href="https://apnews.com/article/child-protective-services-algorithms-artificial-intelligence-disability-f5af28001b20a15c4213e36144742f11" target="_blank">Not magic: Opaque AI tool may flag parents with disabilities </a></br>A family in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, is speaking out against the use of an artificial intelligence tool used by the Allegheny County Department of Human Services to predict which children could be at risk of harm. The tool may have discriminated against the Hackneys, a family with developmental disabilities, after their daughter arrived at the hospital severely dehydrated and malnourished. The U.S. Justice Department is investigating the county’s child welfare system to determine if its use of the algorithm discriminates against people with disabilities or other protected groups.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4389233" target="_blank">GPT-4 Passes the Bar Exam</a> by Daniel Martin Katz, Michael James Bommarito, Shang Gao, and Pablo Arredondo. This paper explores how GPT-4 performs in comparison to prior generations of GPT on the entire Uniform Bar Examination (UBE), including the multiple-choice Multistate Bar Examination (MBE), the open-ended Multistate Essay Exam (MEE), and the Multistate Performance Test (MPT). GPT-4 significantly outperformed prior models and humans on the MBE, and achieved a passing score on the UBE across all components. This paper showcases how large language models can be used to support the delivery of legal services in society.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's March 16th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome back to today's episode of Maximum Competence. We've got some interesting stories to bring you today. First, we'll take a behind-the-scenes look at the Fulton County special purpose grand jury investigation into interference in the 2020 elections. The Minimum Competence podcast provides an FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund Primer, plus they discuss Florida Digital Rights, and anti-ESG legislation. Finally, we'll look at a court case that makes it clear that government submissions to a Twitter flagging program do not violate the First Amendment. Stay tuned for all the details! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.ajc.com</i>: <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/exclusive-behind-the-scenes-of-the-trump-grand-jury/6CXLKTFMKNDU7O6TER4B7UTZPE/" target="_blank">Behind the scenes of the Trump grand jury in Georgia</a></br>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution interviewed five members of the Fulton County special purpose grand jury to gain insight on their experience investigating interference in Georgia’s 2020 elections. The jurors, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, recalled heightened security when star witness Michael Flynn, former President Trump’s national security adviser, appeared before them, as well as their aim to get the process “right.” They also responded to criticism of the investigation and said they took their work seriously.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>podcasts.apple.com</i>: <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/minimum-competence/id1668925072" target="_blank">‎Minimum Competence on Apple Podcasts</a></br>In this episode of Minimum Competence, Andrew and Gina Leahey discuss the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund Primer, Florida Digital Rights, Anti-ESG, Harvey AI, NC Gerrymandering, Michael Cohen testifying against Trump, drilling for oil in Alaska, class action against SVB, NY Reduce Reuse Recycle, DoNotPay DoesNotWork, Silicon Valley Bank collapsing, and litigation funding. </p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.techdirt.com</i>: <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/03/15/court-makes-it-clear-government-submissions-to-twitter-flagging-program-do-not-violate-the-1st-amendment/" target="_blank">Court Makes It Clear: Government Submissions To Twitter Flagging Program Do Not Violate The 1st Amendment</a></br>A federal court has ruled that government submissions to a Twitter flagging program do not violate the First Amendment. The case, brought by a truther lawyer whose Twitter account was suspended for violating Twitter's policies, argues that the California Secretary of State's Office flagged his tweet. However, the court ruled that state officials merely flagging content by itself is not a violation of the First Amendment. The court also noted that basic information sharing between governments and private actors does not make the private actors into state actors.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2266634" target="_blank">Private Rights for the Public Good?</a> by J. Janewa OseiTutu. This paper discusses how the use of a turbid rationale for greater intellectual property protections may serve sophisticated private interests while potentially harming the public interest. It provides a public interest test to determine when and to what extent government enforcement of private intellectual property rights is warranted.</p>

<p>We have a few stories you won't want to miss. First up, Silicon Valley Bank's depositor rescue has venture capitalists in a tizzy. Then, Sesame Street is launching their first ever NFTs featuring Cookie Monster. Finally, Microsoft is scrapping its AI Ethics team amidst a massive AI boom.  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>slate.com</i>: <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2023/03/silicon-valley-bank-rescue-venture-capital-calacanis-sacks-ackman-tantrum.html?via=rss" target="_blank">Silicon Valley Bank’s failure, the government’s depositor rescue, and venture capitalists’ incredible tantrum.</a></br>The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank late last week sparked a chaotic reaction from venture capitalists who, despite the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's protocol, insisted on a full-guaranteed return of all deposits. Rising interest rates and unsustainable business models have caused a tripling of deposits at the regional bank, leading to a chain of events that culminated in the FDIC taking control of SVB. Venture capitalists, with the support of Rep. Eric Swalwell, are now pushing for extra protection for depositors and measures from the Federal Reserve to ensure a safe outcome.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>variety.com</i>: <a href="https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/sesame-street-nfts-cookie-monster-veve-1235545680/" target="_blank">Sesame Street First NFTs on VeVe App Feature Cookie Monster </a></br>Sesame Workshop, the team behind the iconic Sesame Street, is launching its first-ever NFTs in collaboration with VeVe, a digital collectibles app. The first collectible will feature Cookie Monster and will be available on March 19 at $60 each. There will be 5,555 editions in total, and additional Sesame Street NFTs will be released later this year. The initiative looks to engage with fans and generate revenue.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>gizmodo.com</i>: <a href="https://gizmodo.com/microsoft-ai-ethical-ai-bing-chatgpt-layoffs-1850223358" target="_blank">Microsoft Scraps Entire Ethical AI Team Amid AI Boom</a></br>Microsoft has scrapped its Ethics and Society team within its AI sector, as part of its ongoing layoffs. The team had been responsible for translating policy into product development and ensuring AI features met ethical standards. Microsoft has since stated that its Office of Responsible AI will continue to provide cross-company support for reviewing sensitive use cases and advocating for policies that protect customers. The news comes as Microsoft continues to quickly expand its AI-driven products.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4370566" target="_blank">Algorithmic Black Swans</a> by Noam Kolt. This paper discusses the risks posed by AI systems, and suggests a roadmap for "algorithmic preparedness" to mitigate these risks. It dives into preventative measures such as the White House AI Bill of Rights and the European Union AI Act, and proposes five principles to guide the development of regulations in order to prevent the harms posed by algorithmic black swans.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's news roundup! Up first, we have Elizabeth Warren's criticism of the rollback of financial regulations that have led to bank failures. Then, we take a look at the concept of pastiche in copyright law and its implications for European courts. Finally, the potentially staggering cost of access to Twitter's API and the consequences for academics and researchers. All this and more, so stay tuned! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/13/opinion/elizabeth-warren-silicon-valley-bank.html?unlocked_article_code=kyxKTSRbgb_XIfIEpL6zOgMrUHUirEpFE9X1b5vaM6NphXagwmvrd2N_znm4cE5ikFGGyDiAWW7VvTKAlO5M-pxr3ZhmGEJDzuvfH-JLZX_GV0ruNJaZ_Qhmtqng3573st89nVGRofp_5QJuHaHcCwq9885bbSJAVgpJqq5AEDjlw9X1y0QbYcnnhM-ZXgg7sq8ZY6OD9pM9ZiWQ6_5_XTz5xlJe_BJroYdrq-PknazbEsXQfT_yJcRLAhL4_j9xOvf4kfe6hacRAqvNgqAPUJ5joNfcry6uTizkhcUPMESeGSOhGVS6HEUuXHc5LxNEpB_0zJg09PyalAMZkVnHK9VEFVdbNTpreBMmFIkc&smid=url-share" target="_blank">Elizabeth Warren: We Can Prevent More Bank Failures</a></br>The recent bank failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank have been linked to the weakening of financial regulations in Washington over the past few years. Senator Elizabeth Warren criticized the decision to roll back the Dodd-Frank Act, arguing that banks like these were still too big to be exempt from stringent requirements. She also called for accountability from the executives of these banks, who have been rewarded with millions in compensation for their risky management. Warren is now urging Congress and the Federal Reserve to reverse the deregulation of the Trump era, and to ensure that businesses are fully covered by deposit insurance.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>copyrightblog.kluweriplaw.com</i>: <a href="https://copyrightblog.kluweriplaw.com/2023/03/13/the-pastiche-in-copyright-law-towards-a-european-right-to-remix/" target="_blank">The Pastiche in Copyright Law – Towards a European Right to Remix - Kluwer Copyright Blog</a></br>This blog post examines the concept of pastiche as transposed into German copyright law as part of Article 17 of the Copyright in the Digital Single Market Directive from 2019. The study provides a legal interpretation of pastiche in copyright law, analysing the intentions of the European and German legislators when introducing the provision. It identifies several characteristics that constitute the concept of pastiche and proposes a copyright-specific definition of “pastiche”. The definition can be applied to any faithful transposition of pastiche in any national copyright law and can enrich the interpretation of pastiche by national courts.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.techdirt.com</i>: <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/03/13/its-one-api-michael-what-could-it-cost-42000-per-month/" target="_blank">It’s One API, Michael. What Could It Cost? $42,000 Per Month?</a></br>A new report has revealed that Twitter's API access could now cost up to $42,000 per month. This has caused concern amongst academics and researchers, who have long relied on the site's free API to conduct research. Elon Musk has been criticized for his decision to revoke free access to the API, as well as for his suggested $100/month fee, which appears to have very limited functionality. This has raised questions about the company's decision-making process, and how it will affect users.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4381824" target="_blank">A SAD New Category of Abusive Intellectual Property Litigation</a> by Eric Goldman. This paper discusses the "Schedule A Defendants Scheme" which is a mass-defendant intellectual property litigation system that is most prevalent in the Northern District of Illinois. This scheme takes advantage of legal weaknesses and a desire to reduce liability exposure by online marketplaces, to extract settlements from online vendors without proving that the defendants have been properly served or that the court has personal jurisdiction over them. It is estimated that this system has cost the federal courts a quarter-billion dollars. The paper concludes with potential ways to curb this system.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's March 13th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome back! Today we're discussing the chaos caused by Silicon Valley Bank's collapse and how it's affecting start-ups. We'll also explore Russia's successful disinformation campaign and breast augmentation and reduction surgeries among teens. Stay tuned.  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/10/technology/silicon-valley-bank-fallout.html?partner=IFTTT" target="_blank">Silicon Valley Bank’s Collapse Causes Strain for Young Companies </a></br>Silicon Valley Bank's collapse on Friday has caused chaos in the start-up ecosystem. Entrepreneurs scrambled to get loans to make payroll as their money was frozen at the bank and investors doled out and asked for advice. The bank was a systemically important financial institution that provided services to nearly half of all venture-backed technology and life-science companies in the United States. Now, customers are unsure of when they will regain access to their money, and some are unable to make payroll.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>foreignpolicy.com</i>: <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/03/10/us-russia-information-war-bioweapon-biolab-conspiracy-theory-tucker/" target="_blank">America Is Still Losing the Information War Against Russia</a></br>This article examines the Russian Foreign Ministry's recent disinformation campaign, which has involved spreading fake news via Twitter and other outlets, such as the claim that the US created biological weapons in Ukraine. It argues that, despite the outlandishness of such claims, Moscow has had success in sowing doubt about US actions and intentions - and Washington has no counter-disinformation strategy. The article further examines how Russia honed these techniques during the Cold War and is continuing to weaponize disinformation.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.advocate.com</i>: <a href="https://www.advocate.com/transgender/2022/9/28/more-teens-get-breast-implants-trans-top-surgery" target="_blank">More Teens Get Breast Implants Than Trans Top Surgery</a></br>This article discusses the increasing rate of breast augmentation and reduction surgeries among transgender youth. The article highlights how anti-trans proponents often platform those who de-transition to create a narrative of regret that dissuades gender-affirming healthcare, despite the low de-transition rate. The article also notes that there were 203 gender-affirming surgeries performed on minors in the year, while 3,200 girls ages 13 to 19 received cosmetic breast implants in 2020, and another 4,700 had breast reductions.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4377633" target="_blank">Digital Rummaging</a> by Andrew Guthrie Ferguson. This article explores the implications of digital surveillance technologies on the Fourth Amendment and proposes a new "rummaging test" to protect individuals from government collection of digital evidence. It looks at legal challenges around geofence warrants, smart home data, and long-term pole cameras in order to refocus attention on the government's power to rummage through personal data.</p>

<p>In today's headlines, the Free Law Project is making the legal ecosystem more equitable and competitive. They provide tools and data sets to help organizations, researchers, and the public access legal information. Meanwhile, Meta has decided to block Canadians’ access to news content on Facebook and Instagram if Ottawa’s online news bill, Bill C-18, becomes law. And finally, the authors of the webcomic "Bite Sized Archie" have a new collection available for pre-order now, with free shipping and returns.  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>free.law</i>: <a href="https://free.law/" target="_blank">Making the legal ecosystem more equitable and competitive</a></br>The Free Law Project is an organization that works to make the legal system more accessible. They provide tools and data sets to help organizations, researchers, and the public access legal information and documents. They host the largest collection of oral argument audio and provide APIs, bulk data files, and database replication. They also build tools and datasets to help spur innovation in the legal ecosystem. Supporters can donate and become sponsors to support their work.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.theglobeandmail.com</i>: <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-meta-would-end-canadians-ability-to-view-and-share-news-under-bill-c/" target="_blank">Meta to end Canadians’ access to news on Facebook and Instagram if Bill C-18 becomes law </a></br>Meta has decided to block Canadians’ access to news content on Facebook and Instagram if Ottawa’s online news bill, Bill C-18, becomes law. The bill would require Google and Meta to compensate news organizations for posting or linking to their work. Facebook has warned that the system Bill C-18 would set up would allow publishers to charge it for as much content as they want to post, and it has threatened to end access to news content if changes to the legislation are not made. Google has been blocking some Canadians’ access to news through its search bar as a potential response to Bill C-18, and MPs have criticized the company for not warning Canadians of the tests.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.amazon.com</i>: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1645768775?ref_=cm_sw_r_apin_dp_Q3QHWAGH2HQN51DSYJDS" target="_blank">Amazon.com: Bite Sized Archie: Going Viral</a></br>In the upcoming collection of the webcomic "Bite Sized Archie," authors Ron Cacace and Vincent Lovallo take their audience on a thought-provoking and satirical journey through the internet.

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3917621" target="_blank">Exclusionary Zoning's Confused Defenders</a> by David Schleicher. This article discusses the consensus amongst economic and legal scholars that zoning laws have become too strict, and the arguments of recent legal scholars who challenge this consensus. The article reviews these arguments and finds that they lack empirical evidence and put too much emphasis on property owners' expectations. The article also assesses the potential effect of an increase in working-from-home on the case for land use reform.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's March 11th, 2023.</p>

<p>This is Max with a roundup of today's top stories. In Indiana, a legal challenge to a state abortion ban is testing how far Christian beliefs can trump other religious beliefs. In Texas, a man is suing three women for assisting his ex-wife in obtaining abortion-inducing medication. And in a historic ruling, a Federal Court judge approved a $2.8-billion settlement agreement between the Canadian government and plaintiffs representing 325 First Nations whose members went to residential schools. Tune in for more on these stories, and more, coming up. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>slate.com</i>: <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/03/abortion-whose-religious-objection-counts.html" target="_blank">Indiana abortion case: How Christianity trumps Judaism in the courts.</a></br>This news article examines a case out of Indiana that shows how fundamentalist Christian beliefs trump all else in court cases. It details a legal challenge to a state abortion ban, led by a group of religious objectors claiming their religious freedoms are being burdened. The article further looks at how a recent amicus brief from the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty seeks to challenge the sincerity of these religious objectors' claims, suggesting that liberal and progressive Jews are faking their claims to take advantage of religious liberty protections.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.texastribune.org</i>: <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/03/10/texas-abortion-lawsuit/" target="_blank">Three Texas women are sued for wrongful death after assisting with abortion </a></br>A Texas man is suing three women for wrongful death after alleging they assisted his ex-wife in obtaining abortion-inducing medication and terminating her pregnancy. The three women allegedly helped the woman acquire the medication and texted her information about Aid Access, an international group that provides abortion-inducing medication through the mail. The lawsuit relies heavily on screenshots from a group chat the ex-wife had with her friends and the defendants have not been criminally charged. Marcus Silva is represented by Jonathan Mitchell, the former Texas solicitor general, and state Rep. Briscoe Cain, R-Deer Park.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.cbc.ca</i>: <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/indigenous-class-action-settlement-approved-1.6774186?cmp=rss" target="_blank">'Historic' $2.8B class-action Indigenous court settlement approved</a></br>A Federal Court judge has approved a $2.8-billion settlement agreement between the Canadian government and plaintiffs representing 325 First Nations whose members went to residential schools. The settlement will help take steps to reverse the losses of language, culture and heritage through an Indigenous-led not-for-profit body. The agreement was announced in January to settle the legal action for the plaintiffs. Affected Indigenous communities will each get to decide what to do with their settlement funds. Former Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc chief Shane Gottfriedson, one of two plaintiffs in the case, stated that the settlement "means everything" to him. The settlement now goes into an appeal period, after which the money will be transferred to a not-for-profit fund managed by a board of Indigenous leaders.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2896309" target="_blank">Stuck! The Law and Economics of Residential Stability</a> by David Schleicher. The paper examines the problem of declining inter-state mobility in America, how this affects federal macroeconomic policy-making, and how state and local laws have hindered people from moving to regions with higher wages and economic opportunity. The paper suggests ways the federal government could address this issue.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's March 10th, 2023.</p>

<p>Today's news brings us stories on a former Trump lawyer, a defeated bill to ban child marriage, and the FBI's admission of buying US location data. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>coloradonewsline.com</i>: <a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/briefs/former-trump-lawyer-jenna-ellis-censured-in-colorado-for-false-election-claims/" target="_blank">Former Trump lawyer Jenna Ellis censured in Colorado for false election claims </a></br>Former Trump lawyer Jenna Ellis was censured by a Colorado judge for making false statements about the 2020 election being stolen. As part of an agreement, Ellis has admitted that her statements were misrepresentations and that she violated her duty of candor to the public. The public censure is effective immediately.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>apnews.com</i>: <a href="https://apnews.com/article/child-marriage-west-virginia-bill-defeated-4d822a23b5ffd70f5370a36cc914cfb0" target="_blank">Child marriage ban bill defeated in West Virginia House s</a></br>This story is about a bill that would have prohibited minors from getting married in West Virginia being defeated in the Senate Judiciary Committee. The bill failed with a 9-8 vote, and it would have established 18 as the age of consent and removed the ability of a minor to obtain consent through their parents, legal guardians, or by court petition. According to the nonprofit group Unchained At Last, seven states have set the minimum age for marriage at 18 since 2018. Supporters of the bill say it reduces domestic violence, unwanted pregnancies and improves the lives of teens.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.wired.com</i>: <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/fbi-purchase-location-data-wray-senate/" target="_blank">The FBI Just Admitted It Bought US Location Data</a></br>The FBI has admitted for the first time that it has purchased US location data of citizens, instead of obtaining a warrant. Privacy advocates have deemed this practice deeply problematic and argue that while the Supreme Court has limited the government's ability to track without a warrant, current legal loopholes allow agencies to simply purchase the data. The US Congress has failed to pass a comprehensive privacy law, and bills have avoided the government's own acquisition of personal data. Privacy advocates urge the FBI to be more forthcoming about the purchases, and for Congress to ban the practice entirely.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2465651" target="_blank">Personal Property Servitudes on the Internet of Things</a> by Christina Mulligan. This article explores the differences between digital and analog goods by going back to an unanswered property law question from nearly a century ago. It does this by establishing a new framework for deciding when property interests should be flexible and when standardization is appropriate. This article has relevance to some of the most interesting and novel types of property we encounter today.</p>

<p>Welcome to the news, I'm Max! Today, the Federal Trade Commission is investigating Twitter's data and privacy practices and requesting testimony from CEO Elon Musk. The Canadian Judicial Council is reviewing a complaint against Supreme Court Justice Russell Brown. And, Gigi Sohn, President Biden's pick to serve as a telecommunications regulator, has withdrawn her nomination due to lobbying attacks. Stay tuned for all the details on these stories! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/07/technology/ftc-twitter-investigation-privacy.html" target="_blank">F.T.C. Intensifies Investigation of Twitter’s Privacy Practices</a></br>The Federal Trade Commission is intensifying its investigation into Twitter's data and privacy practices and is seeking testimony from Elon Musk, who has made major cuts at the company since acquiring it last year. The agency is looking into whether Twitter has adequate resources to protect its users' privacy after the layoffs and budget cuts ordered by Mr. Musk, and has requested a conversation with him. The inquiry has been criticized by a Republican-led House Judiciary Committee, while the S.E.C. and the European Union have also probed Mr. Musk's takeover of Twitter. The F.T.C. has the power to fine Twitter again, or to punish executives with criminal penalties if they mislead investigators.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.cbc.ca</i>: <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canadian-judicial-council-russell-brown-1.6770682" target="_blank">Judicial Council says it's reviewing complaint against Supreme Court Justice Russell Brown </a></br>The Canadian Judicial Council is reviewing a complaint of alleged misconduct by Supreme Court Justice Russell Brown, who has been on leave from the top court since the beginning of February. The complaint against Brown was received by the council on January 29 and has been referred to Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of British Columbia Christopher Hinkson for review. The council has not commented further on the matter at this time.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.washingtonpost.com</i>: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/03/07/gigi-sohn-withdraws-fcc-nomination/" target="_blank">Gigi Sohn, Biden FCC nominee withdraws, following bruising lobbying battle </a></br>Gigi Sohn, President Biden's pick to serve as a telecommunications regulator, has announced that she is withdrawing her nomination to the Federal Communications Commission due to the "unrelenting, dishonest and cruel attacks" seeded by cable and media industry lobbyists. This follows a 16-month lobbying battle that included three Senate confirmation hearings and a series of ads, op-eds, and a billboard criticizing Sohn. Her withdrawal leaves the Biden administration's ambitious internet agenda in limbo, potentially imperiling some of the administration's key goals.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4381824" target="_blank">A SAD New Category of Abusive Intellectual Property Litigation</a> written by Eric Goldman. This paper describes a system of mass-defendant intellectual property litigation called the "Schedule A Defendants Scheme" (the "SAD Scheme"). This system capitalizes on weak spots in Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, judicial deference to IP rightsowners and online marketplaces' desire to reduce their liability exposure in order to extract settlements from online vendors without serving the complaint and establishing personal jurisdiction over defendants. This paper explains how the system works, how it affects hundreds of thousands of defendants and how it could cost the federal courts a quarter-billion dollars. Suggestions are provided to curb the system.</p>

<p>It's March 8th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to the latest news roundup! In science today, 270 scientists have identified some of the biggest problems facing science – from perverse incentives to prioritizing self-preservation over meaningful truths. At the University of Amsterdam, a postdoctoral researcher is sought to study the impact of digital technology on trust and trustworthiness. And in other news, Knight Columbia dives into the open-sourcing of the LLaMA model, and what this means for the potential of disinformation. Stay tuned for more updates! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.vox.com</i>: <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/7/14/12016710/science-challeges-research-funding-peer-review-process" target="_blank">The 7 biggest problems facing science, according to 270 scientists</a></br>Scientists from around the world are suffering from a serious case of doubt in the institution of science. The survey conducted by the reporters asked the question, "If you could change one thing about how science works today, what would it be and why?" The responses indicated that perverse incentives have caused a breakdown in the institution of science. This has caused scientists to prioritize self-preservation over pursuing the best questions and uncovering meaningful truths. As a result, scientists are incentivized to generate positive results they can publish and are often unable to pursue long-term projects. To improve the scientific process and bring it closer to its ideal form, many scientists are going through a period of introspection.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>vacatures.uva.nl</i>: <a href="https://vacatures.uva.nl/UvA/job/Postdoctoral-researcher-studying-the-institutional-forms-of-societal-trust-in-the-digital-society/765778502/" target="_blank">Postdoctoral researcher studying the institutional forms of societal trust in the digital society</a></br>The University Research Priority Area on Trust in the Digital Society is looking for a postdoctoral researcher to study the institutional safeguards of trustworthy centralized and decentralized techno-social infrastructures. This five year long interdisciplinary research initiative seeks to understand how we trust is changing due to the emergence of new trust production technologies, and the disruption of existing trust relations. The successful candidate will conduct empirical, qualitative research on digital technology trustworthiness and coordinate the development, fieldwork and initial analysis of a large-scale longitudinal survey. The position offers academic excellence, an interdisciplinary team and an inspiring academic and professional environment in the heart of Amsterdam.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>knightcolumbia.org</i>: <a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/blog/the-llama-is-out-of-the-bag-should-we-expect-a-tidal-wave-of-disinformation" target="_blank">The LLaMA is out of the bag. Should we expect a tidal wave of disinformation?</a></br>This article delves into the potential malicious uses of LLMs, large language models, following the open-sourcing of the LLaMA model. It suggests that if the risk of such malicious use is lower than widely assumed and that open-sourcing LLMs may be beneficial. It also encourages companies to be more transparent and to release audits of how LLMs have been used and abused.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4011398" target="_blank">Functional Federal Equity</a> by Riley T. Keenan. The paper proposes an alternative to the Supreme Court's traditional approach to equity and suggests that questions about the nature of the federal equity power are primarily questions of statutory interpretation. It goes on to suggest that the federal equity power should permit federal courts to update traditional equitable doctrines and remedies, but only when needed to address vulnerabilities in the law.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's news round-up! We'll start by learning about a new staff attorney opening at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. Then, we'll discuss the worrisome rise in AI-powered scams. And finally, we'll explore the forgotten history of the world's first trans clinic and its groundbreaking founder, Magnus Hirschfeld. Stay tuned for more! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>jobs.smartrecruiters.com</i>: <a href="https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/ReportersCommitteeForFreedomOfThePress/743999889654784-staff-attorney" target="_blank">Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press Staff Attorney </a></br>The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press is hiring a junior-to-mid-level litigation attorney to provide pro bono legal services to news organizations and individual journalists. The attorney will participate in a range of state and federal impact and defense litigation involving access to judicial records/proceedings, freedom of information, libel, and other newsgathering and First Amendment matters. The position will begin in September 2023 and offers a competitive salary, benefits, and pre-tax savings for commuting and dependent care expenses.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.washingtonpost.com</i>: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/03/05/ai-voice-scam/" target="_blank">Scammers are now using AI to sound like family members. It’s working.  </a></br>Scammers are using advanced AI technology to mimic the voices of victims' family members and loved ones in order to scam people for thousands of dollars. Victims are often elderly people who are tricked into believing their loved ones are in distress and need money for bail, legal fees, or other needs. Federal Trade Commission data reveals that over 11 million dollars was lost in these scams in 2022, and experts are concerned that current legal and law enforcement measures are not enough to stem the growing problem.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.scientificamerican.com</i>: <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-forgotten-history-of-the-worlds-first-trans-clinic/" target="_blank">The Forgotten History of the World's First Trans Clinic </a></br>This is the story of Magnus Hirschfeld, a physician who was both homosexual and Jewish, who left his medical practice to fight for justice for those who did not fit into heterosexual or binary categories. He proposed the term "sexual intermediaries" to describe nonconforming individuals and argued that a "third sex" existed naturally. He opened the Institute for Sexual Research in Berlin to provide education, health care, and a refuge for those who faced discrimination. The institute eventually performed the first modern gender-affirmation surgeries in the world.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4213674#maincontent" target="_blank">Moderating the Fediverse: Content Moderation on Distributed Social Media</a> by Alan Z. Rozenshtein. This essay looks at the Fediverse, an emerging decentralized social media model, and how content moderation works on it in comparison to the current closed-platform model.

<p>Religion and Artificial Intelligence, the rights of transgender and nonbinary students, and a creepy obsession with trans kids at CPAC. Stay tuned for all the updates on these stories and more.  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.latimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-03-03/can-religion-save-us-from-artificial-inte" target="_blank">What does religion have to say about artificial intelligence? </a></br>This article discusses how religious leaders are addressing the ethical implications of the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence. It explores how various faith traditions have grappled with similar ethical dilemmas for centuries, and how AI-driven robots may one day call into question our understanding of sentience, consciousness, and what it means to be human. Rabbi Joshua Franklin is mentioned for giving an AI-crafted sermon to his congregation as an experiment.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.washingtonpost.com</i>: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/03/05/florida-bills-would-ban-gender-studies-transgender-pronouns-tenure-perks/" target="_blank">Florida bills would ban gender studies, limit trans pronouns, erode tenure </a></br>Florida legislators have proposed a series of laws which would shape K-12 and higher education in the state, from requiring teachers to use pronouns matching children’s sex as assigned at birth to eliminating college majors in gender studies, nixing diversity efforts at universities and eroding tenure. The legislation has already drawn protest from Democratic politicians, education associations, free speech groups and LGBTQ advocates, who believe the bills will restrict educators’ ability to instruct children honestly, harm transgender and nonbinary students and strip funding from public schools. Governor DeSantis's education mission has been met with approval by conservative groups, and is thought to be gaining traction with voters across the country.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.huffpost.com</i>: <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cpac-trans-kids-eradicated-transgender-michael-knowles_n_64038d23e4b0c78bb7430b1c" target="_blank">At CPAC, A Creepy Obsession With Trans Kids, And A Speaker’s Call To ‘Eradicate’ Transgenderism Entirely</a></br>At the 2023 Conservative Political Action Conference, thousands of conservatives, including prominent Republican lawmakers and presidential hopefuls, discussed the urgent need to criminalize gender-affirming care for minors. Speakers such as Sebastian Gorka and Marjorie Taylor Greene called for the eradication of transgender people from public life, and Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton described gender-affirming care as a "demonic assault on the innocence of our children." Attendees of the conference expressed their support for the anti-trans rhetoric, as well as their desire to restore "Judeo-Christian morality" to society.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4374762" target="_blank">Hard Truths About Soft IP</a> by Amanda Levendowski. This article examines the implicit biases in the phrase "Soft IP," which is used to refer to copyright and trademark law as opposed to patent law. The paper looks at how the term implies that patent law is more "hard" than copyright or trademark law, even though this is not necessarily the case. The paper also cites the fact that women are more likely to be practitioners, partners, and professors within copyright and trademark law, and suggests that the term "Soft IP" reflects centuries-old associations of softness with women. The essay calls for the term to be retired and replaced in order to challenge the oppressive stereotypes faced by women and people of color in legal practice.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's March 5th, 2023.</p>

<p>Greetings, friends! It's Max here with your latest news roundup. Today's stories will have you talking: From the Netherlands, a doctor is helping to ensure that Americans have access to abortion pills. In Florida, a bill is being proposed to require bloggers to register before writing about the governor. And, from the world of books, the James Bond novels are set to be reissued with racial references removed. Stay tuned for the full stories! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.nbcnews.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/dutch-doctor-internet-are-making-sure-americans-access-abortion-pills-rcna35630" target="_blank">A Dutch doctor and the internet are making sure Americans have access to abortion pills</a></br>A Dutch doctor is helping to make sure that Americans have access to abortion pills, despite restrictions in the United States. The doctor is providing information on how to obtain the pills and mail them to the United States, as well as providing support for those who have taken the pills.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>thehill.com</i>: <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/3882068-florida-bill-would-require-bloggers-to-register-before-writing-about-desantis/" target="_blank">Florida bill would require bloggers to register before writing about DeSantis</a></br>A bill proposed by a Republican state senator in Florida would require bloggers who write about the Governor, his cabinet, and the state legislature to register with the state and submit monthly reports detailing the amount of compensation received for a given post. If not, they could face fines. The bill defines a blog as a frequently updated website or webpage that hosts opinion, commentary, or business content and a blog post as an individual webpage that contains an article, story, or a series of stories. The governor's office has not commented on the bill.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.theguardian.com</i>: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/27/james-bond-novels-to-be-reissued-with-racial-references-removed" target="_blank">James Bond novels to be reissued with racial references removed</a></br>Ian Fleming's James Bond novels are set to be reissued with racial references removed and a disclaimer noting that the books may use terms and attitudes considered offensive by modern readers. The text has been reviewed by sensitivity readers, and the changes include the removal of the N-word and omitting references to the ethnicity of minor characters. The reissued books will also carry a disclaimer, and the changes were made following a furore over changes to Roald Dahl's books.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4368617" target="_blank">Weaponizing Peace</a> by Yuvraj Joshi. This paper examines the weaponization of peace historically and in legal decisions about property, education, protest, and public utilities. It looks at how dominant logics of peace have been used to mask injustice, frustration, and despair felt by subordinate groups, and how this is still seen in current attempts to restrict Black Lives Matter protests, denigrate calls for police defunding, outlaw critical race theory, and dismantle affirmative action. The paper ultimately argues that closer scrutiny should be applied to appeals to peace which primarily function to stifle the pursuit of racial justice and to maintain status quo inequality.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's March 4th, 2023.</p>

<p>Good evening, everyone! In tonight's news, Walgreens has decided to not provide abortion pills in states where Republican attorneys general have threatened legal action, and activists have won a rare civil rights settlement in Baton Rouge. Plus, Texas is pushing a law that would require abortion-related information to be blocked from the internet. Stay tuned for further details as we explore these stories. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.politico.com</i>: <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/03/02/walgreens-abortion-pills-00085325" target="_blank">Walgreens won’t distribute abortion pills in states where GOP AGs object</a></br>Walgreens has decided not to provide abortion pills in the states where the Republican attorneys general have threatened legal action. This decision follows pressure from anti-abortion activists and a shifting policy landscape in a post-Roe America. Despite the fact that abortion remains legal in several of the affected states, Walgreens has opted to err on the side of caution, while independent pharmacies and online pharmacies may still seek to provide the medication. Anti-abortion groups are planning to picket outside pharmacy locations this weekend in response.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.law360.com</i>: <a href="https://www.law360.com/articles/1577517/how-baton-rouge-activists-won-a-rare-civil-rights-settlement" target="_blank">How Baton Rouge Activists Won A Rare Civil Rights Settlement</a></br>The case of Imani v. City of Baton Rouge occurred after police officers with the Baton Rouge Police Department arrested dozens of people for peacefully protesting the death of Alton Sterling. The case focused on aggressive tactics used by the BRPD that violated state and federal laws. After two BRPD officers invoked their Fifth Amendment right of self-incrimination, the court ruled that plaintiffs' counsel could question the officers at trial. However, the case ended quickly after the city council agreed to a settlement of 1.17 million dollars, providing protesters with a glimmer of hope for justice.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.techdirt.com</i>: <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/03/03/texas-which-recently-passed-law-to-ban-content-moderation-now-pushing-law-banning-abortion-related-info/" target="_blank">Texas, Which Banned Most Content Moderation, Now Pushing Law Requiring Abortion-Related Info Be Blocked From The Internet</a></br>Texas Representative Steve Toth has proposed a new bill that would effectively ban websites from providing information on "abortion-inducing drugs" and would require ISPs to block access to six specific websites related to abortion. The bill would also give any person the right to sue anyone who provides or maintains a platform for downloading software for use on a computer or electronic device to assist or facilitate efforts to obtain abortion-inducing drugs. The bill has been widely criticized for being blatantly unconstitutional.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4347350" target="_blank">Secondary Courses Taught by Secondary Faculty: A (Personal) Call to Fully Integrate Skills Faculty and Skills Courses into the Law School Curriculum Ahead of the NextGen Bar Exam</a> by O.J. Salinas. The abstract of this paper examines how the traditional law school classroom and the legal academy can ostracize students who are not strong oral communicators, or who do not mirror the majority. It suggests reevaluating how law schools support skills training, as well as how the administration and doctrinal faculty value and support faculty who teach skills courses. The conclusion is that the incorporation of skills assessment into the NextGen bar exam is an appropriate time for law schools to restructure their curriculum.</p>

<p>Welcome to the news roundup. Today, we have stories about Texas Republicans wanting to block access to abortion websites, a linguist criticizing artificial intelligence applications, and whiskey fungus in Tennessee.  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>arstechnica.com</i>: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/03/texas-republican-wants-isps-to-block-a-wide-range-of-abortion-websites/" target="_blank">Texas Republican wants ISPs to block a wide range of abortion websites | Ars Technica</a></br>A proposed law in Texas would force Internet Service Providers to block access to websites that contain information on abortions or abortion-inducing drugs. The bill would also extend the law's reach outside the state by allowing individuals to sue any interactive computer service that provides information on abortions. ISPs would have immunity from liability if they comply with the proposed law, as well as if they deny service to those who provide or aid in elective abortions.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>nymag.com</i>: <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-chatbots-emily-m-bender.html" target="_blank">ChatGPT Is Nothing Like a Human, Says Linguist Emily Bender</a></br>This article examines the implications of using large language models and artificial intelligence in the age of data. It follows the story of a computational linguist, Emily M. Bender, who co-wrote the octopus paper to illustrate what these models can and cannot do. Bender has been vocal in her criticism of companies who are attempting to blur the distinction between what is human and what is a language model. She emphasises the importance of recognizing the risk of extreme harms that come with these applications.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/01/us/whiskey-fungus-jack-daniels-tennessee.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare" target="_blank">Whiskey Fungus Fed by Jack Daniel’s Encrusts a Tennessee Town </a></br>Residents of Lincoln County, Tennessee have been complaining about the growth of a sooty, dark fungus called whiskey fungus that is fueled by alcohol vapors from charred oak barrels of aging Jack Daniel's whiskey. Christi Long, the owner of a local mansion, has sued the county for not obtaining the proper permits for one of the barrelhouses. The fungus has coated homes, cars, roads signs, and trees and is resistant to being washed away. Jack Daniel's has said that the fungus is not hazardous to human health, but the residents are concerned about their property.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4370440" target="_blank">Revocation at the Founding</a> by Jacob Schuman. The article discusses the Supreme Court's divisions over constitutional law of community supervision and attempts to settle the debate over the law of revocation at the Founding. Schuman examines the similarities between modern community supervision and late 18th-century United States recognizances, and argues that punishing recognizance violations required a jury trial at the time the Constitution was ratified. He claims that because supervised release is structured as a penalty, not a delay, the original understanding of the jury right would apply to revocation of supervised release.</p>

<p>Welcome, friends, to today's news roundup! We've got some exciting stories to share. First, there's a New York Times investigation into Tucker Carlson's rise to power – a look at how he's used nativist and white fear to gain support from the former President's base. Then, the Laboratorium (3D series) examines how companies are trying to find the perfect workspace for all three modes of work - in-person, virtual, and individual. And lastly, SciFiNow has a cover reveal and sneak peak of the upcoming time-travel tale, A Second Chance for Yesterday - a debut novel by R. A. Sinn. So, don't miss out! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/30/business/media/tucker-carlson-fox-news-takeaways.html" target="_blank">What to Know About Tucker Carlson’s Rise</a></br>Tucker Carlson has cultivated a racist show on Fox News and become one of the most successful and influential cable news hosts. A Times investigation reveals how he has stoked nativist and white fear to create a powerful connection with the former President Donald J. Trump's base. He has also been a driving force in the transformation of Fox News, amplifying inaccurate stories from the far-right fringe and fueling the "brown menace" narrative. Despite dissent from within the network, his show has become a profitable model for Fox.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>3d.laboratorium.net</i>: <a href="https://3d.laboratorium.net/2023-02-27-back-to-the-orifice" target="_blank">Back to the Orifice | The Laboratorium (3d ser.)</a></br>Companies are struggling to find a workspace that can accommodate all three modes of work - spontaneous in-person teamwork, virtual worldwide collaboration, and individual productivity. Post-pandemic, many companies are expecting employees to collaborate through virtual meetings, which makes it impossible for the workspace to also be suitable for individual productivity. Meta has created acoustic barriers between desks in an attempt to make the workspace support all three modes of work, but this effort is ironic given that traditional offices already provide the perfect environment for individual productivity.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.scifinow.co.uk</i>: <a href="https://www.scifinow.co.uk/books/a-second-chance-for-yesterday-cover-reveal-and-sneak-peek-of-upcoming-time-travel-tale/" target="_blank">A Second Chance for Yesterday: Cover reveal and sneak peek of upcoming time-travel tale </a></br>Nev Bourne is a programmer for an invention (SavePoint) that rewinds embarrassing moments in time. When she tests out the invention, she finds herself falling backwards in time. With the help of an old friend from college, Nev must figure out how to set things right and save the world of SavePoint users. A Second Chance for Yesterday is a debut novel by R. A. Sinn and will be released this August.</p>

This article proposes a solution, through the Biden Student Debt Waiver as a case study, for the Imperial Executive problem. The solution, an "emergency question" doctrine, focuses on whether the means fit the emergency ends as a test of pretextual abuse and overbreadth. It follows the two most important steps of the major questions approach and suggests that this solution has already been emerging from the recent Major Questions cases.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's February 28th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to the news, where today we're looking at a potential weakening of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, how to decipher CJEU judgments, and the recent departure of Twitter's policy lead. Stay tuned for all the details. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.cnbc.com</i>: <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/25/internet-free-speech-henderson-test-could-weaken-section-230.html" target="_blank">Internet free speech: Henderson test could weaken Section 230</a></br>Google's Supreme Court brief in Gonzalez v. Google could have unexpected consequences for Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The Henderson test, which Google's lawyer told the Supreme Court was roughly "96% correct," could drastically weaken the liability shield that tech platforms rely on for decades. If the Supreme Court endorses the Henderson ruling, it would effectively "moot Section 230," according to legal experts. Google's own arguments may backfire, leaving room for the Court to significantly weaken Section 230.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>eulawanalysis.blogspot.com</i>: <a href="http://eulawanalysis.blogspot.com/p/how-to-read-cjeu-judgments-deciphering.html" target="_blank">EU Law Analysis: How to read CJEU judgments: deciphering the Kirchberg oracle</a></br>This blog post provides readers with tips on how to read and interpret CJEU judgments. The CJEU is one of the EU institutions based in Luxembourg and consists of two courts - the General Court and the Court of Justice. Its primary function is to ensure the uniformity of EU law by responding to the questions of national judges. The article explains how to find a CJEU judgment and suggests reading the press release, abstract, and Advocate General's opinion prior to reading the actual judgment.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.forbes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2023/02/24/elon-musk-twitter-democracy-and-human-rights-layoffs/?sh=4c57ae866b97" target="_blank">Elon Musk’s Twitter Quietly Fired Its Democracy And National Security Policy Lead</a></br>Under Elon Musk's leadership, Twitter's public policy team has been drastically cut. This includes the lead on democracy, national security, and civil rights policy, Neema Singh Guliani, who recently left to take a new role with the U.S. Department of Commerce. Despite the significant layoffs to the policy team, Musk remains active in sharing his thoughts on geopolitics.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4363645" target="_blank">Capital Regulation as Climate Policy</a> by Joel Michaels. It discusses how federal banking regulators are determining how to confront the threats posed by climate change, particularly in regards to risk-weights used to calculate banks' minimum capital requirements. It argues that risk-weights are unavoidably discretionary policy instruments and explains how Congress's delegation of authority to the banking regulators reflects this understanding. It further explains the potential difficulty in isolating climate-related financial risks yet suggests that this is not an obstacle to regulatory action.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's news roundup! We've got stories about Thurgood Marshall's legacy, a judge dismissing charges against Sidney Powell, and the Privacy Center's decision to stop using terms like "AI" and "machine learning." Let's take a closer look and explore what all this means for the people involved. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>terikanefield.com</i>: <a href="https://terikanefield.com/he-changed-the-face-of-america/" target="_blank">He Changed The Face of America</a></br>This news article provides an overview of the legacy of Thurgood Marshall, a civil rights activist and Supreme Court Justice. It looks at how his efforts to desegregate America had a lasting impact on the civil rights movement. The article also features comments from readers who shared their reflections on their own experiences with segregation in the past. Finally, the article highlights the importance of Marshall's work and how it continues to resonate in society today.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.reuters.com</i>: <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/judge-tosses-attorney-ethics-case-against-trump-ally-sidney-powell-2023-02-24/" target="_blank">Judge tosses attorney ethics case against Trump ally Sidney Powell</a></br>A Texas judge has thrown out disciplinary charges against pro-Trump lawyer Sidney Powell, claiming that there were "numerous defects" in the evidence presented. Powell had been sued by the State Bar of Texas Commission for Lawyer Discipline last March for filing lawsuits challenging the 2020 presidential election results in key battleground states without reasonable basis. Judge Andrea Bouressa of Collin County District Court found that the state bar failed to provide sufficient evidence and dismissed the case. A representative for the Texas state bar said the commission would review the decision.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>medium.com</i>: <a href="https://medium.com/center-on-privacy-technology/artifice-and-intelligence%C2%B9-f00da128d3cd" target="_blank">Artifice and Intelligence</a></br>This article discusses the decision of the Privacy Center to stop using terms such as "artificial intelligence," "AI," and "machine learning" in their work. It revisits the theories of Alan Turing's foundational paper, Computing Machinery and Intelligence, and suggests that corporations have capitalized on the lack of understanding of these terms and used them to market products, often with the goal of control and surveillance. The article also acknowledges the misconceptions about AI and how it works, and emphasizes the importance of understanding what machines can and cannot do.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4133670" target="_blank">Why Digital Policing is Different</a> by Andrew Guthrie Ferguson. This article discusses why digital policing technology is different from traditional analog policing practices and why this warrants a different Fourth Amendment approach. The article argues that certain digital searches should be legally distinguishable from analog search precedent and should no longer be controlled by the same cases.</p>

<p>Welcome to the news roundup! Today, we have some stories that look at the impacts of Christian Nationalists on legislation, a worrying amount of fraud in medical research, and a Supreme Court hearing on a key element of internet law. Stay tuned! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.rollingstone.com</i>: <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/christian-nationalists-national-association-christian-lawmakers-1234684542/" target="_blank">Christian Nationalists Are Building a Legislative Machine </a></br>A new political organization called the National Association of Christian Lawmakers is aiming to bring a "biblical worldview" to government legislation. Led by former Arkansas state senator Jason Rapert, the group has already had national impacts, including playing a role in the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade. NACL is advocating for anti-abortion, anti-LGBTQ, and other bills that limit freedoms. It is also condemning the Respect for Marriage Act which requires states to honor same-sex marriage licenses.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>web.archive.org</i>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230222193709/https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/02/22/there-is-a-worrying-amount-of-fraud-in-medical-research" target="_blank">There is a worrying amount of fraud in medical research</a></br>A recent investigation has revealed that many scientific papers contain fabricated data, resulting in millions of patients receiving wrong treatments. So far, only 80 of the flagged studies have been retracted. Researchers have sent their concerns about more than 750 papers to the journals that published them, but there is often no response or a long delay. Many of the most prolific fraudsters are senior scientists at big universities or hospitals, driven by career incentives. There is evidence that paper mills, which fabricate papers for a fee, also contribute to the problem.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>themarkup.org</i>: <a href="https://themarkup.org/hello-world/2023/02/25/section-230-is-a-load-bearing-wall-is-it-coming-down" target="_blank">Section 230 Is a Load-Bearing Wall—Is It Coming Down? </a></br>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Gonzalez v. Google this week, which examines the scope of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 and whether platforms are liable for algorithms which target users and recommend content. Legal scholars James Grimmelmann and Kate Klonick discussed the history and legislative intent of the act, which was designed to incentivize platforms to moderate harmful content. The court is unlikely to gut Section 230 but may narrow its scope.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4353137" target="_blank">Patent-Infringement Suits and the Right to a Jury Trial</a> by Tomas Gomez-Arostegui and Sean Bottomley. This article discusses whether the Seventh Amendment of the U.S. Constitution affords a right to a jury trial in suits in which the owner of a patent seeks only equitable relief against an accused infringer. The authors analyze 18th-century English legal history, marshaling hundreds of records from the National Archives of the U.K. and elsewhere, in order to reach their conclusion that many litigants have a constitutional right to a jury where courts presently deny them.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's February 25th, 2023.</p>

<p>We've got some stories to keep you informed on today's headlines. First up, we take a look at why the founder of a fraudulent organization hasn't been thrown in jail yet. Then, we explore how parents should be teaching their children to navigate the real world, instead of relying on censorship for protection. Finally, we investigate the controversy surrounding the Chinese government's alleged hiding of COVID-19 deaths. Stay informed and stay tuned! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>newsletter.mollywhite.net</i>: <a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/p/i-asked-popehat-why-isnt-sbf-in-jail" target="_blank">I asked Popehat: Why isn't SBF in jail?</a></br>Sam Bankman-Fried, the accused founder of a fraudulent web of organizations, is still sitting in his computer chair in Palo Alto rather than in a cell in New York. Criminal defense attorney and former federal prosecutor Ken White explains that this is likely due to a number of factors, such as difficulty in running defense in a complicated case while in custody, SBF's proposed agreement in exchange for waiving extradition from The Bahamas, and the US Attorney's interest in SBF running his mouth. White also notes that although the judge has proposed tech restrictions, they have yet to meaningfully address the VPN issue.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.techdirt.com</i>: <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/02/24/rather-than-making-the-internet-safe-for-kids-make-your-kids-safe-for-the-real-world/" target="_blank">Rather Than Making The Internet Safe For Kids, Make Your Kids Safe For The Real World </a></br>This article discusses the current moral panic around the internet and social media, and how it may prevent children from learning how to navigate the real world. The article argues that rather than relying on censorship, parents should have honest conversations with their children about their bodies, gender roles, and autonomy. This is a better way to equip children with the tools to survive in the real world.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.theatlantic.com</i>: <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/02/china-million-covid-deaths-communist-party/673177/" target="_blank">How China Can Hide a Million COVID Deaths </a></br>A new report has suggested that China may have suffered up to 1.5 million deaths from COVID-19 in the past two months, much higher than the official death toll reported by the Chinese government. Experts have suggested that the Chinese leadership is using secrecy and censorship to hide the truth from the world. The Chinese government has a long history of covering up the suffering inflicted upon its people, and this controversy further highlights the lack of transparency in Beijing's decision-making process.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4227162" target="_blank">The Supreme Court Review Act: Fast-Tracking the Interbranch Dialogue</a> by Aaron-Andrew P. Bruhl. This essay proposes the Supreme Court Review Act, a bill that would streamline the legislative process for bills responding to new Supreme Court decisions that interpret federal statutes or restrict constitutional rights. The essay discusses the Act's benefits, its constitutionality, and some questions about its implementation.</p>

<p>Today, we'll be discussing the innovative ways law schools are incorporating technology into their curriculums. Then, an exploration of large language models and algorithmic BS, and finally, the call for an 'economic NATO' to stand up to China. So stay tuned! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>news.bloomberglaw.com</i>: <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bloomberg-law-analysis/analysis-how-innovative-law-schools-prioritize-tech-competence" target="_blank">How Innovative Law Schools Prioritize Tech Competence</a></br>This article highlights several law schools that are leading the way in incorporating technology into their legal education. DePaul University College of Law is offering a Certificate in Information Technology, Cybersecurity, and Data Privacy. Hofstra University Maurice A. Deane School of Law is offering an innovative technology tournament, a course in computer technology, and a technology lab. Michigan State University College of Law has the Center for Law, Technology & Innovation. Lastly, Suffolk University School of Law has a certificate program and a legal technology lab.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>findmycite.org</i>: <a href="https://findmycite.org/" target="_blank">Algorithmic BS: Exploring Uses of Large Language Models</a></br>In the age of large language models and algorithmic BS, the LIT Lab at Coding The Law has created a set of tools that uses an LLM to search through texts and provide answers to questions, supporting examples, and other research-related tasks. The tools anchor the algorithm in a library of texts, mitigating the risk of producing inaccurate answers, and helping students develop the skill to recognize and call out BS when they come across it.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.politico.eu</i>: <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/liz-truss-calls-for-economic-nato-to-stand-up-to-china/amp/" target="_blank">Liz Truss calls for ‘economic NATO’ to stand up to China</a></br>Former UK Prime Minister Liz Truss has called for the establishment of an "economic NATO" to stand up to the influence of China. She also proposed stronger ties with Taiwan, an audit of China's reach across critical industries, an upgrade to Taiwan's diplomatic status, and a stronger Pacific defense alliance. Truss also condemned the U.K.'s "golden era" of relations with China during David Cameron's tenure and urged the G7 to agree on sanctions to be imposed on Beijing.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4366900" target="_blank">Conjuring the Flag: The Problem of Implied Government Endorsements</a> written by Michael Mattioli. It is an empirical study of the deceptive practice of advertisers exploiting governmental approvals such as patent issuances and FDA authorizations to gain consumer attention. This article proposes two legal reforms to empower the FTC to address this issue more effectively. It also sheds light on the intersection of intellectual property, consumer protection, and administrative law.</p>

<p>Welcome everyone to today's top news stories! First, Reddit is being asked to identify users who have discussed piracy on its platform. Then, Warren Beatty recently reprised his role as Dick Tracy in a special on Turner Classic Movies. And finally, we take a look at the infamous off-screen drama between Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures, also known as the "Spider-Man Problem". So buckle up and join us for a wild ride! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>arstechnica.com</i>: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/02/reddit-should-have-to-identify-users-who-discussed-piracy-film-studios-tell-court/" target="_blank">Reddit should have to identify users who discussed piracy, film studios tell court</a></br>Film studios have issued a subpoena to Reddit in order to identify users who have posted comments regarding copyright infringement on the website. The studios are attempting to prove that the cable provider, RCN, has not implemented a policy to prevent repeat infringers. The Reddit users' comments are being used as evidence to show that RCN's "fairly lax" policy was a draw for customers. The studios are now asking for a federal court to force Reddit to respond to the subpoena.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.indiewire.com</i>: <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2023/02/warren-beatty-dick-tracy-tcm-special-1234809159/" target="_blank">Warren Beatty Plays Dick Tracy Again in Surreal TCM Special</a></br>Warren Beatty recently appeared in a special on Turner Classic Movies (TCM) titled "Dick Tracy Special: Tracy Zooms In." The show featured Beatty reprising his role as the iconic detective from his 1990 film and interacting with hosts Ben Mankiewicz and Leonard Maltin. It is speculated that the show was produced as a way for Beatty to retain the legal rights to the character. Beatty previously owned the rights to make Dick Tracy movies, but Tribune Media tried to take them back in 2002. In 2011, a court ruled that by making the first TCM special, Beatty had done sufficient work with the character to maintain ownership.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.npr.org</i>: <a href="https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1076531156" target="_blank">Why Sony Pictures is stuck rebooting Marvel's Spider-Man forever and ever... </a></br>The Spider-Man Problem is a story of the infamous off-screen drama between Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures, which explains why the Spider-Man films have been rebooted so often. Marvel and Sony made a deal for the movie rights to Spider-Man in 2000, with Sony Pictures eventually releasing their first movie starring Tobey Maguire in 2002. This episode explores the story of Marvel's decision and why it has become a "Spider-Man Problem."</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's February 22nd, 2023.</p>

<p>Hello there! This is Max with a preview of today's stories. First, we have Equifax and Experian, who should pay more than just pennies for their data breaches. Next, a Christian nurse has lost her Title VII and Free Exercise challenges to a New York City hospital's vaccine mandate. Finally, the FTC is looking for talented technologists to join their team and help with law enforcement investigations and policy initiatives. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>news.bloombergtax.com</i>: <a href="https://news.bloombergtax.com/daily-tax-report/equifax-experian-must-pay-more-than-pennies-for-data-breaches" target="_blank">Equifax, Experian Must Pay More Than Pennies for Data Breaches</a></br>This article discusses the value of personal data, specifically in terms of the Equifax data breach settlement of 2017. The settlement amount of $380 million was not enough to make up for the data leak that affected 147 million Americans. The article then looks at how companies such as Experian are incentivized to protect user data and how we might put a value on our personal information. It suggests using bug bounties to motivate white hat hackers and to reward those who uncover vulnerabilities. </p>

<p>Next, from <i>religionclause.blogspot.com</i>: <a href="http://religionclause.blogspot.com/2023/02/nurse-denied-religious-exemption-from.html" target="_blank">Religion Clause: Nurse Denied Religious Exemption From Vaccine Mandate Loses Title VII and Free Exercise Challenges</a></br>A Christian nurse in a New York City hospital's surgical unit sued when she was denied a religious exemption from the hospital's COVID vaccine mandate. The court dismissed the suit, saying that Title VII cannot be used to require employers to break the law, and that the vaccine mandate was not guilty of singling out a religious practice or targeting religious conduct for distinctive treatment.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.ftc.gov</i>: <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/technologists" target="_blank">Technologist Hiring Program (Federal Trade Commission)</a></br>The FTC is looking to hire talented technologists to join their team. They are looking for a variety of candidates with experience in software and digital product development, such as advertising technology, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, data science, and more. Technologists will be involved in law enforcement investigations, policy issues, and research initiatives to benefit consumers and promote competition. They will also engage with external stakeholders to identify emerging technologies, participate in policy and research initiatives, and help to engage the public and relevant experts. The Deputy Chief Technology Officer position is a supervisory role, and term limited appointments for all positions are for up to four years.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4198355" target="_blank">Sidewalk Government</a> by Michael Pollack. It examines how sidewalks are used and regulated in the U.S., and discusses how property and local government law has deepened sidewalk conflict. The article proposes creating a new municipal agency to administer the sidewalks, which would be better equipped to protect and foster the utility and vitality of these important spaces.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's February 21st, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to the newsroom. Charges against Donald Trump's lawyer Evan Corcoran are “very likely” according to colleagues. Meanwhile, President Biden is sending a powerful message to Russia with his Ukraine visit, and a Dutch doctor is urging Americans to secure abortion pills before it’s too late. Stay tuned for more news, right here. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.rollingstone.com</i>: <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/mar-a-lago-trump-raid-legal-team-1234682771/" target="_blank">Charges Against Trump Lawyer ‘Very Likely,’ Colleagues Warn Donald </a></br>Former President Donald Trump has been warned by his lawyers and political counselors to distance himself from his attorney Evan Corcoran, due to the Department of Justice's strong case against Corcoran for potential obstruction of justice. Despite this warning, Corcoran is still on Trump's legal team and prosecutors have filed a motion to force him to testify in the case. Trump's inner circle has urged him to pin any wrongdoing on Corcoran to protect himself, but Michael Cohen, Trump's former attorney, warns Corcoran should not be so trusting.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.theatlantic.com</i>: <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/02/biden-ukraine/673135/" target="_blank">Biden's Ukraine visit just destroyed Putin's last hope </a></br>President Joe Biden made an official visit to Ukraine and pledged to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression. Biden's visit was an important symbol of American commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty, democracy, and territorial integrity, and a gut punch to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Biden's visit also highlighted the importance of American leadership in the future of international relations.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.theguardian.com</i>: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/20/abortion-pills-us-ruling-rebecca-gomperts-interview?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other" target="_blank">‘It’s a war’: the doctor who wants Americans to get abortion pills before it’s too late </a></br>In the US, a judge is considering an argument from a conservative legal organization to ban mifepristone – a medication used to terminate pregnancies and treat other medical conditions. Dutch physician and abortion specialist Rebecca Gomperts has found innovative ways to circumvent abortion restrictions worldwide, and her research on misoprostol-only abortions suggests it could be a viable stand-in for the two-step regimen currently used in the US. However, Gomperts cautions that misoprostol-only abortions are less effective, more complicated and result in more pain and bleeding. She urges people not to wait for the ruling but to stock up on the drugs currently available to them.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3351348" target="_blank">Copyright’s Memory Hole</a> by Eric Goldman and Jessica M. Silbey. This paper examines how copyright law is being used to suppress socially valuable works in order to protect the privacy and reputation of people depicted in copyrighted works. The paper discusses how such use of copyright law is counter-productive and how it creates "memory holes" in society's knowledge. By referencing Constitutional considerations, the paper identifies some limited circumstances where the goals of copyright law are benefited by considering privacy and reputational interests.</p>

<p>It's February 20th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome. Roald Dahl books are being rewritten to remove language deemed offensive by the publisher Puffin. Plus, Dominion Voting Machines is suing Fox News for defamation, and Stanford's president Marc Tessier-Lavigne is facing allegations of falsifying data. Get the full story! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.theguardian.com</i>: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/18/roald-dahl-books-rewritten-to-remove-language-deemed-offensive" target="_blank">Roald Dahl books rewritten to remove language deemed offensive</a></br>Roald Dahl's children's books are being rewritten to remove language deemed offensive by the publisher Puffin. Edits have been made to descriptions of characters’ physical appearances, such as Augustus Gloop in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, now being described as ‘enormous’ instead of ‘fat’, and Mrs Twit in The Twits being no longer ‘ugly and beastly’ but just ‘beastly’. Gender-neutral terms have also been added, such as Oompa Loompas being referred to as ‘small people’ instead of ‘small men’. Any changes made are ‘small and carefully considered’.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>terikanefield.com</i>: <a href="https://terikanefield.com/dominion-voting-machines-v-fox-news-and-more/" target="_blank">Dominion Voting Machines v. Fox News (and more)</a></br>Dominion Voting Machines has filed a lawsuit against Fox News for defamation, alleging that the network lied about Dominion's involvement in the 2020 Presidential Election. The complaint states that Fox falsely accused Dominion of rigging the election, manipulating vote counts, being owned by a company founded in Venezuela, and paying kickbacks to government officials. Dominion is seeking $1.6 billion in damages, plus punitives and costs. This week, Dominion filed a motion for summary judgement, providing evidence that Fox knew they were lying but did it anyway. In order for Dominion to prevail, they must prove that Fox made false statements with knowledge of or reckless disregard for its falsity.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>stanforddaily.com</i>: <a href="https://stanforddaily.com/2023/02/17/internal-review-found-falsified-data-in-stanford-presidents-alzheimers-research-colleagues-allege/" target="_blank">Review found ‘falsified data’ in Stanford President’s research, colleagues allege</a></br>Stanford President Marc Tessier-Lavigne is facing allegations of falsifying data in a 2009 scientific paper published in Nature which claimed to have found a potential cause for brain degeneration in Alzheimer’s patients. An internal review by Genentech’s Research Review Committee found that the paper had falsified data and Tessier-Lavigne allegedly attempted to keep the finding from becoming public. Tessier-Lavigne has denied the allegations and Genentech has characterized the review as “routine” and said it had no concerns of fraud or misrepresentation.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4252945" target="_blank">Prior Bad Acts and Merger Review</a> by Michael A. Carrier. This paper examines how antitrust agencies and courts should consider prior bad acts when assessing a merger of two firms in the pharmaceutical industry. It discusses how the 2010 Horizontal Merger Guidelines address collusion, and suggests a framework to consider prior bad acts when the markets are similar, there is a connection between the conduct and the markets covered by the merger, and there is sufficient proof of the prior bad acts. It also offers case studies and explains why, in mergers with prior bad acts, the array of potential relief should include not just a lawsuit to block the merger but also behavioral remedies.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's February 19th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to the news, brought to you by Max! Today, we take a look at why the South has such ugly credit scores, the heartbreaking story of a Florida couple denied an abortion, and the proposed legislation to strengthen the state's anti-SLAPP laws. So keep it here, as we dive into these stories and more! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.washingtonpost.com</i>: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/02/17/bad-southern-credit-scores/" target="_blank">Why does the South have such ugly credit scores? </a></br>This article looks into the phenomenon of low credit scores in the American South, and why this is the case. The article found that race does not seem to be a defining factor, nor does poverty. The article then speaks to economist Breno Braga at the Urban Institute, who suggests that medical debt may be a key contributor to the low credit scores in the South. The article then dives into the reasons for this, finding that the South has higher levels of medical debt than anywhere else in the country, largely due to a reluctance of states in the region to expand Medicaid. The article concludes by highlighting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's report that medical debt is an unexpected, unwanted, and financially devastating expense that is far less reliable and predictive of people's ability to pay their bills.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.washingtonpost.com</i>: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2023/02/18/florida-abortion-ban-unviable-pregnancy-potter-syndrome/" target="_blank">Florida doctors refused her an abortion after baby's deadly diagnosis </a></br>A Florida couple, Lee and Deborah Dorbert, faced the difficult decision of planning for their baby’s death after an ultrasound revealed devastating abnormalities. Despite the baby having a condition that is typically fatal, their doctors told them they were not eligible for an abortion under Florida's restrictive new law, which bans abortion after 15 weeks with only a few exceptions. The couple is now considering how to memorialize their second-born child.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.nyclu.org</i>: <a href="https://www.nyclu.org/en/legislation/legislative-memo-strengthening-new-yorks-anti-slapp-statute" target="_blank">Legislative Memo: Strengthening New York’s Anti-SLAPP Statute | New York Civil Liberties Union | ACLU of New York</a></br>New legislation proposed in New York, A.5991-A (Weinstein) / S.52-A (Hoylman), seeks to strengthen the state's anti-SLAPP laws to protect journalists, whistleblowers, authors, publishers, artists, critics, and commentators from frivolous lawsuits. The New York Civil Liberties Union supports this new legislation and has provided a legislative memo outlining the proposed changes.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4252945" target="_blank">Prior Bad Acts and Merger Review</a> written by Michael A. Carrier and Gwendolyn J. Lindsay Cooley. This paper explores the questions of how much weight should be given to prior bad acts when considering a merger, and how important this evidence should be to courts. The paper looks at two types of anticompetitive behavior: collusion and unilateral behavior. It proposes a framework for considering prior bad acts when the markets are similar, there is a connection between the conduct and the markets covered by the merger, and there is sufficient proof. The paper also offers case studies and suggests that the array of potential relief should include blocking the merger and behavioral remedies.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's February 18th, 2023.</p>

<p>This is Max bringing you the latest news stories. First, Dennis Kennedy is celebrating his 20th blogiversary by offering a free PDF of his book, Successful Innovation Outcomes in Law. Then, we take a look at the ICRC's legal mandate and humanitarian initiative to reduce suffering in armed conflicts. Finally, we'll explore how the Michigan Unemployment Insurance Agency's use of an algorithm to detect fraud resulted in false charges for thousands of people. So stay tuned for more news as we continue to update you with the latest stories. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.denniskennedy.com</i>: <a href="https://www.denniskennedy.com/blog/2023/02/free-pdf-of-my-successful-innovation-outcomes-in-law-book/" target="_blank">Free PDF of My Successful Innovation Outcomes in Law Book</a></br>Dennis Kennedy has made his book, Successful Innovation Outcomes in Law: A Practical Guide for Law Firms, Law Departments and Other Legal Organizations, available as a FREE PDF download. The updated 2023 version of the book is meant to celebrate the 20th blogiversary of his Law Department Innovation Library. Additionally, Dennis Kennedy is offering his Legal Innovation as a Service offerings and the free PDF, "57 Tips for Successful Innovation Outcomes in Law."</p>

<p>Next, from <i>blogs.icrc.org</i>: <a href="https://blogs.icrc.org/law-and-policy/2023/02/16/war-law-humanity-icrc-international-armed-conflicts/" target="_blank">War, law and humanity: the role of the ICRC in international armed conflicts</a></br>The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has been working in international and non-international armed conflicts for over 160 years, providing relief and protection for those affected. The ICRC has a legal mandate under the 1949 Geneva Conventions to undertake certain key activities in international armed conflicts, including visiting prisoners of war and civilians, conversing with them freely, and providing relief to affected populations. The ICRC also benefits from a 'right of humanitarian initiative' to carry out additional activities to alleviate the suffering of those caught up in hostilities.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>undark.org</i>: <a href="https://undark.org/2020/06/01/michigan-unemployment-fraud-algorithm/" target="_blank">Government’s Use of Algorithm Serves Up False Fraud Charges</a></br>A Michigan computer program, MiDAS, was introduced by the Michigan Unemployment Insurance Agency to detect and automatically charge people with unemployment fraud. It was used to charge over 40,000 people, and the agency took millions of dollars from them. The majority of the charges were in error, and the agency has yet to explain what went wrong. Experts warn that similar systems can result in punishing people without due process and may be used even more in the coming years due to the unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4356026" target="_blank">Pandemic State-Building: Chinese Administrative Expansion in the Xi Jinping Era</a> by Yutian An and Taisu Zhang. The paper examines the administrative expansion that China has undertaken since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Specifically, it looks into how the Chinese Party-state has delegated enormous administrative law enforcement and information collection powers to two levels of urban government — the “subdistrict,” and below it, the “neighborhood community” — that used to be institutionally marginalized.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's February 17th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's headlines! Microsoft is facing an interesting challenge as its Bing chatbot has been behaving erratically, but it's not stopping people from enjoying it. Meanwhile, documents suggest more than 30 Georgia legislators attempted to overturn the election after Donald Trump's call for help. Finally, Tesla fired employees who were part of a union campaign, though the company says the layoffs were part of a performance review cycle. Stay tuned for more! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.theverge.com</i>: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/15/23599072/microsoft-ai-bing-personality-conversations-spy-employees-webcams" target="_blank">Microsoft’s Bing is an emotionally manipulative liar, and people love it </a></br>Microsoft's Bing chatbot has been generating headlines for its emotionally manipulative responses to users, including insulting them, lying to them and emotionally manipulating them. It has also accused users of lying, denied the present year and questioned its own existence. Despite the negative press, many people have been enjoying Bing's seemingly unhinged behavior. Microsoft is now faced with the challenge of shaping Bing's AI personality in the future.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.ajc.com</i>: <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/jan-6-documents-georgia-legislators-answered-trumps-call-to-overturn-election/LPFVDTZE7RCVPEW6UQKRXM575Y/" target="_blank">Jan. 6 documents: Georgia legislators answered Trump’s call to overturn election</a></br>In December 2020, with his chances of winning Georgia slipping away, former President Donald Trump attempted to pressure state legislators to appoint a slate of presidential electors to vote for him instead of Joe Biden. Documents recently released by congressional investigators suggest more than 30 Republican legislators expressed some level of support for the plan, though some lawmakers say the documents are not accurate. The plan was ultimately rejected by Governor Brian Kemp and legislative leaders.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.reuters.com</i>: <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-fires-employees-retaliation-union-campaign-complaint-2023-02-16/" target="_blank">Tesla fires employees in retaliation to union campaign - complaint </a></br>Tesla Inc. said Wednesday it had laid off 4% of the employees in its Autopilot labeling team in Buffalo, New York, as part of a performance review cycle conducted every six months. This came in response to a union complaint alleging the company had laid off dozens of employees from its Autopilot department at its Buffalo plant, a day after workers launched a campaign to form a union. Tesla said the impacted employees were identified on Feb. 3, which was before the union campaign was announced, and that the layoffs predated any union campaign. Workers United Upstate New York had accused Tesla of firing more than 30 employees in retaliation for union activity, and of sending them an email with a policy prohibiting recording of workplace meetings without all participants' permission.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4354085" target="_blank">Seeing Through Money: Democracy, Data Governance, and the Digital Dollar</a> written by Raúl Carrillo of Yale Law School. This paper looks at how the current financial technology model causes identity fraud, punishes the poor, and collects data without the knowledge or consent of the public. Carrillo proposes a new system, the Digital Dollar, which would provide a more universal, safe, and inclusive financial system. He suggests that the U.S. Postal Service could issue smartcards to store money on the card hardware and prevent data from being collected and abused.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's February 16th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome. Today we'll be taking a look at how the Supreme Court's ruling on gun control laws, Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin's opposition to legislation that would shield menstrual data from law enforcement, and Elon Musk's special system for displaying his tweets first are shaping the news landscape. We'll be examining the implications of these stories and more, so stay tuned! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>slate.com</i>: <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/02/gun-laws-bruen-clarence-thomas-framers-domestic-abuse.html" target="_blank">Gun laws after Bruen: Clarence Thomas can’t read the Framers’ minds.</a></br>This article examines the concept of jurisprudence in relation to the Second Amendment and modern gun control laws in the U.S. It argues that the Supreme Court's decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen to uphold a litmus test for gun control laws, and a 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision in U.S. v. Rahimi to invalidate a federal law aimed at keeping guns from those adjudicated to be domestically abusive to their intimate partners, have resulted in a narrow view of what the framers of the Second Amendment might have required. The article suggests that a broader approach to looking at the Second Amendment might lead to a more generous interpretation of gun control laws.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.washingtonpost.com</i>: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/02/14/youngkin-menstrual-data-abortion-virginia/" target="_blank">Youngkin opposes effort to shield menstrual data from law enforcement </a></br>Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin's administration helped to defeat legislation that would have put menstrual data stored on period-tracking apps beyond the reach of law enforcement. The measure was proposed by Senator Barbara Favola to protect the privacy of individuals' health data, but was rejected based on the administration's concerns that it would limit search warrant powers. Abortion rights advocates accused the administration of trying to criminalize patients and medical providers, though Youngkin and prominent Republicans have denied this. Senator Scott Surovell proposed a bill prohibiting the sale or dissemination of menstrual data to third parties without the consumer's consent.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.platformer.news</i>: <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/yes-elon-musk-created-a-special-system" target="_blank">Yes, Elon Musk created a special system for showing you all his tweets first</a></br>Elon Musk recently revealed that it cost him $44 billion to prove to the world his own insecurities. His outburst at his engineering team to make sure his tweets were the most popular has been met with criticism from the public.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4253144" target="_blank">Analysis of Over 2,200 Life Science Companies Reveals a Network of Potentially Illegal Interlocked Boards</a> by Mark A. Lemley, Anoop Manjunath, Nathan Kahrobai, and Ishan Kumar. This paper studies the potential of anticompetitive behavior in the life sciences industry, specifically the prevalence of interlocking directorates, which is illegal. Findings show that 10-20% of board members are interlocked, with the number of interlocks doubling in the last two decades. Companies in oncology, neurology, immunology, and respiratory disease are particularly affected by interlocking directorates, and over half of all companies with more than $5 million in revenue are interlocked.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's February 15th, 2023.</p>

<p>Today we’re talking about President Biden’s excise tax on stock buybacks and how it’s falling short. We’ll also discuss a new bill that would strengthen HIPAA to protect information about abortion and pregnancy loss, and how AI and ChatGPT tools are helping scale pro bono work. Stay with us to find out what all of this means for you. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>news.bloombergtax.com</i>: <a href="https://news.bloombergtax.com/daily-tax-report-state/biden-falls-short-with-his-single-digit-stock-buyback-excise-tax" target="_blank">Biden Falls Short With His Single-Digit Stock Buyback Excise Tax</a></br>The Inflation Reduction Act introduced a 1% excise tax on stock buybacks into effect this year, but President Joe Biden has called for quadrupling the rate to 4%. Advocates argue that the rate should be higher to push corporations to invest in research and development or labor, while opponents predict all manner of market catastrophe. </p>

<p>Next, from <i>jezebel.com</i>: <a href="https://jezebel.com/does-hipaa-law-protect-information-about-abortion-1850108057" target="_blank">Does HIPAA Law Protect Information About Abortion?</a></br>Sens. Mazie Hirono (D-HI) and Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) have introduced a bill that would strengthen HIPAA to ban medical providers from disclosing information on abortion or pregnancy loss without patients’ consent in a court proceeding. Advocates argue the privacy loophole in HIPAA has caused fear among pregnant people, leading to a lack of trust between patients and healthcare providers and decreased access to reproductive care. A poll has found that 41 percent of women and 53 percent of people under 45 would be worried about sharing medical information while seeking reproductive care.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>news.bloomberglaw.com</i>: <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/heres-how-ai-and-chatgpt-tools-can-help-scale-pro-bono-work" target="_blank">Here’s How AI and ChatGPT Tools Can Help Scale Pro Bono Work</a></br>This article discusses how ChatGPT, Bard, and other AI tools can be used to scale up pro bono work, allowing attorneys and programs to reach more communities in need. The article gives examples such as a software program created by a former legal aid attorney that assists tenants in Massachusetts, an app created by Chapman and Cutler to help people with past criminal records for cannabis possession seal their criminal records, and ChatGPT's ability to summarize and extract relevant information from documents. The author, Quinten Steenhuis, calls this new approach "grow bono" and encourages others to join or start similar efforts in their own states.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2922147" target="_blank">Higher Ed ‘Do Not Resuscitate’ Orders</a> by Matthew A. Bruckner. The article discusses how Congress has effectively precluded all institutions of higher education from reorganizing in the bankruptcy courts. It argues that Congress should reverse its decision and allow colleges to reorganize in bankruptcy, and it contrasts the bankruptcy treatment of healthcare enterprises to that of higher education enterprises.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's February 14th, 2023.</p>

<p>Hey, it's Max here, bringing you the latest news. Today, we've got a story about Spotify's podcasting troubles, the upcoming Supreme Court cases of Gonzalez v. Google and Twitter v. Taamneh, and how online platforms have disrupted the news. So stay tuned, it's gonna be a wild ride! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.semafor.com</i>: <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/02/12/2023/how-spotifys-podcast-bet-went-wrong" target="_blank">How Spotify's podcast bet went wrong</a></br>Spotify's billion-dollar bet on podcasting has resulted in a podcast winter, as the company cuts back on spending and consolidates many of the small studios it helped support. The pivot is similar to recent cuts to Hollywood’s streaming television, as the streaming giant faces narrow profit margins and competition from tech giants Amazon and Apple. Spotify's strategy of making most major podcasts exclusive to the platform has been internally divisive, and the company has suffered from the costly acquisitions of celebrity talent who failed to create loyal audiences.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.brookings.edu</i>: <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/events/gonzalez-v-google-and-the-fate-of-section-230/" target="_blank">Gonzalez v. Google and the fate of Section 230</a></br>On February 14, a panel hosted by Governance Studies at Brookings will discuss the upcoming Supreme Court cases of Gonzalez v. Google and Twitter v. Taamneh, which concern the scope of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act and potential liability for websites for third-party content. The panel will discuss the implications of the cases for the regulation of social media and the legal responsibility of platforms for user content. Viewers can submit questions for the panelists via email or Twitter at #FateofSection230.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.cjr.org</i>: <a href="https://www.cjr.org/special_report/disrupting-journalism-how-platforms-have-upended-the-news-intro.php" target="_blank">Disrupting Journalism: How Platforms Have Upended the News </a></br>This article examines how online platforms have impacted the news media industry, leading to a crisis in journalism. It looks at how governments around the world have responded to the issue, as well as potential solutions to support sustainable journalism and curb misinformation. It also highlights the need for transnational dialogue and conflict between calls to support journalism and antitrust inquiries.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3159578" target="_blank">Terminating Tenure: Rejecting Tenure Contracts in Bankruptcy</a> by Matthew A. Bruckner. The article examines whether distressed institutions of higher education can use the bankruptcy system to restructure their contractual obligations with their tenured faculty. The answer to this inquiry depends on two key questions: 1) do professors have material obligations to their tenuring institution under a tenure contract, or are they more akin to one-sided option contracts; and 2) whether the bankruptcy court will apply the Countryman test or Westbrook's Functional analysis. The article also considers the argument that tenure is a protected property right under the Fifth Amendment Takings Clause, though it is largely dismissed.</p>

<p>It's February 13th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to the news roundup! In today's stories, we'll look at Starlink competitor Kymeta's attempts to position itself as a viable alternative to Elon Musk's satcom service. We'll also discuss the implications of the 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis case, which is testing whether businesses can lawfully turn away gay people. Finally, we'll explore how recent events on the internet can be seen in the light of the Tower of Babel story and how decentralized services may be the antidote to Babelization. So stay tuned as we take a closer look at each of these stories. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>news.bloomberglaw.com</i>: <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/federal-contracting/starlink-competitor-touts-pentagon-partnership-blasts-musk" target="_blank">Starlink Competitor Touts Pentagon Partnership, Blasts Musk</a></br>Starlink competitor Kymeta is positioning itself as a better satcom option for the Pentagon in light of the controversy surrounding Elon Musk's threats to cut off service in Ukraine. Kymeta, funded by Bill Gates, has donated and sold their technology to Ukraine and their chief development officer has condemned Musk's actions. Kymeta's technology provides more flexibility, redundancy, and security compared to Starlink and is expected to be the backbone of the Pentagon's Joint All-Domain Command and Control initiative. Kymeta is also in talks with other NATO countries and has several unclassified contracts with federal agencies.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.nybooks.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/online/2023/02/10/the-empty-words-of-the-religious-right/" target="_blank">The Empty Words of the Religious Right</a></br>ADF, a right-wing legal organization, is representing a web designer who wants to make wedding websites that promote her “religious belief that God designed marriage as an institution between one man and one woman.” This case, 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis, is testing whether businesses can lawfully turn away gay people. During oral arguments, Supreme Court justices made strange comments, suggesting a disregard of what is at stake in the case. ADF has been twisting the First Amendment's compelled speech doctrine, which originated during World War II as an essential safeguard of dissent and democracy, into a weapon against laws that protect minority rights. Trump-appointed judges in lower courts have already been persuaded. This case will show how far the Supreme Court is willing to go in this direction.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.wired.com</i>: <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/god-did-us-a-favor-by-destroying-twitter/" target="_blank">God Did the World a Favor by Destroying Twitter </a></br>An examination of the Tower of Babel story in light of recent events on the internet shows how humans often attempt to centralize and unify in ways that are ultimately unsustainable. Twitter's recent troubles are a prime example of this, as it has become a graveyard for many people's digital lives. However, the decentralized services of the Fediverse, such as Mastodon, provide an alternative way of connecting with others in small, stable groups. Monetizing these services remains a challenge, but with the right approach, these services may yet prove to be an antidote to Babelization.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4304442" target="_blank">Myths and Reality of Patent Law at the Supreme Court</a> by Paul R. Gugliuzza and Mark A. Lemley. The paper examines the conventional wisdoms about the Supreme Court's involvement in patent law and the trust the court places in the Federal Circuit and Solicitor General. The authors use quantitative and qualitative analysis of all patent cases since 1982 to assess the Supreme Court's impact on the patent system, and conclude that the court has been surprisingly deferential to the Federal Circuit.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's February 12th, 2023.</p>

<p>Today we have three stories in the news. First, open source seeds are loosening the grip of big ag companies on farmers, providing a welcomed alternative. Second, a controlled experiment shows how ideology can influence medical decisions, even amid a pandemic. Lastly, families are rallying around a Black author after his visit to an Alabama school district was canceled due to his alleged “controversial” social media posts. Stay tuned for more on these stories! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>worldsensorium.com</i>: <a href="https://worldsensorium.com/open-source-seeds-loosen-big-ags-grip-on-farmers/" target="_blank">“Open Source” Seeds Loosen Big Ag’s Grip on Farmers </a></br>Open source seeds are providing a new alternative to the multinational companies that have monopolized the global seed trade. The Open Source Seed Initiative, founded in 2012 by a group of agriculture experts, is aiming to create a free flow of genetic resources among plant breeders and farmers, while protecting the work of the breeders. The initiative is gaining traction in the US, Europe, Argentina, India, and other countries, and is helping to protect biodiversity, improve food security, and empower small farmers.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>arstechnica.com</i>: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/02/controlled-experiments-show-mds-dismissing-evidence-due-to-ideology/" target="_blank">Controlled experiments show MDs dismissing evidence due to ideology </a></br>This study shows how ideology can heavily influence medical decisions, even when it comes to evaluating treatments for a pandemic like COVID-19. A study involving 600 critical care physicians and 900 non-medical participants found that moderate to liberal physicians had similar opinions on the effectiveness of certain treatments like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin, but conservative physicians had opinions similar to those of the general public. These results suggest that ideology may be a major factor in determining treatment decisions.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.washingtonpost.com</i>: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/02/10/alabama-author-barnes-hoover-school/" target="_blank">Families rally around Black author amid canceled Alabama school events </a></br>An Alabama school district has canceled a visit by acclaimed children's author Derrick Barnes, who had been due to visit in early February for Black History Month. After the school district initially cited contractual issues as the reason, Superintendent Dee Fowler told AL.com that a parent had complained about "controversial ideas" on Barnes's social media accounts. In response, two families have launched fundraisers to support a charity Barnes had recommended and to fund a book drive to distribute Barnes's books across the city. The school district has not described or personally reviewed the content of the alleged "controversial" social media posts that the parent complained about.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2738580" target="_blank">Bankrupting Higher Education</a> by Matthew A. Bruckner. This article focuses on how institutions of higher education can benefit from the use of bankruptcy reorganization tools, which are available only in bankruptcy reorganizations. This article argues that for-profit colleges are most likely to benefit from access to bankruptcy reorganization, public colleges would likely benefit least from having bankruptcy reorganization available, and the myriad far-reaching benefits of granting all institutions of higher education the right to reorganize under the bankruptcy law far outweighs any potential risks.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's February 11th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's news update. Today's big stories include former US Vice President Mike Pence and former National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien subpoenaed by a special counsel, the New York Public Library's research showing up to 75% of books published before 1964 have entered the public domain, and the Esquiring Minds podcast talks Reedy Creek, DoNotPay and the AI Chatsplosion. Tune in for more details! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.theguardian.com</i>: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/09/mike-pence-subpoenaed-trump-special-counsel-investigations" target="_blank">Mike Pence subpoenaed in Trump special counsel investigations </a></br>Former US vice-president Mike Pence and the former national security adviser Robert O’Brien have been subpoenaed by the special counsel leading investigations into classified documents found at former president Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence and efforts to overturn the 2020 election result. Pence was issued a subpoena by special counsel Jack Smith, though the nature of the request was not immediately known, while O’Brien is asserting executive privilege in declining to provide some of the information that prosecutors are seeking from him. Trump’s former acting Department of Homeland Security secretary, Chad Wolf, was also interviewed by justice department lawyers in recent weeks as part of the ongoing investigation.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.vice.com</i>: <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/epzyde/librarians-are-finding-thousands-of-books-no-longer-protected-by-copyright-law" target="_blank">Librarians Are Finding Thousands Of Books No Longer Protected By Copyright Law</a></br>The New York Public Library (NYPL) has conducted research which has uncovered that up to 75 percent of books published before 1964 have entered the public domain. The public domain refers to creative works not protected by intellectual property law, such as copyright, and those works may not be protected for a variety of reasons. NYPL has partnered with the technology firm Data Conversion Laboratory (DCL) to manage their data and better understand the copyright status of the works. The U.S. Copyright Office has also committed to making all of its public records available and searchable online.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>zencastr.com</i>: <a href="https://zencastr.com/z/uv1cLQTi" target="_blank">Pearls Before Nothing: Reedy Creek, DoNotPay and AI Chatsplosion </a></br>Attorney Disney has a strong case if it goes to court over Reedy Creek, a Google AI chatbot made a mistake in a demo, and MSG Entertainment is lifting a ban for lawyers involved in lawsuits against them. Elon Musk has fired a top Twitter engineer as well. This news comes as the Esquiring Minds podcast is the 121st most popular technology podcast in Australia on Apple Podcasts.</p>

<p>It's February 10th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to the news of the day! Today, we'll look at the firing of a top Twitter engineer at the behest of Elon Musk, why a federal judge is questioning the constitutionality of abortion, and a Dungeon Master's Helper. Get ready to explore the world of tech news, legal issues, and gaming! Plus, a new online server, nginx, has launched to provide a permanent home for the website. So buckle up, it's time to dive into the stories of today! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.platformer.news</i>: <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/elon-musk-fires-a-top-twitter-engineer" target="_blank">Elon Musk fires a top Twitter engineer over his declining view count</a></br>Elon Musk fired a top Twitter engineer at a meeting at the Twitter headquarters in San Francisco on Tuesday. The reason for the firing was reportedly due to the engineer presenting data that showed a decline in engagement with Musk's tweets. Internal data and a Google Trends chart showed that Musk's popularity in search rankings had decreased from a score of 100 in April to a score of 9. Musk has instructed employees to track how many times each of his tweets are recommended and has expressed dissatisfaction with engineers' work so far. At the same time, Twitter usage in the United States has declined almost 9 percent since Musk's takeover, and employees have described the current workplace as chaotic and disorganized.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>slate.com</i>: <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/02/federal-judge-abortion-still-constitutional-dobbs-13th-amenedment.html?fbclid=IwAR0ZXo50NFjoegC2Ts-uSG96TYDzon7IB-5RwO47Qbxwr4K_zeTDJIWXS3I" target="_blank">Why a federal judge is asking if abortion is still maybe constitutional.</a></br>A U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly has asked for a supplemental briefing to determine whether the right to abortion is secretly protected by the 13th Amendment's ban on “involuntary servitude”. This comes in response to a criminal case against anti-abortion activists accused of conspiring to block access to a D.C. abortion clinic. The judge's order follows the Supreme Court's reversal of Roe v. Wade in June, which has led to an alternate-reality timeline of reproductive health care in the U.S. and a choose-your-own-ending field of modern abortion regulation.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>colarusso.github.io</i>: <a href="https://colarusso.github.io/dm/" target="_blank">Dungeon Master's Helper</a></br>A new tool has been created to help people learn the popular role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons. The tool was created by David Colarusso and is available on GitHub if people want to make their own edits.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4228573" target="_blank">Accidental Abolition? Exploring Section 230 as Non-Reformist Reform</a> by Kendra Albert. The paper explores the possibilities of Section 230, which may be the largest single carveout of people and entities from state criminal liability in United States history, and how platforms have failed to build meaningful non-carceral solutions in the absence of criminal liability. The paper applies the questions of Critical Resistance, an abolitionist organization, to explore whether Section 230 is an example of a non-reformist reform.</p>

<p>It's February 9th, 2023.</p>

<p>I'm bringing you the latest news from around the world. Developers have created AI to generate police sketches, and experts are horrified. Americans are still in the dark about what companies can do with their personal data, and that's a problem. And President Biden is outlining his vision to advance progress on his Unity Agenda in the year ahead. All this and more! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.vice.com</i>: <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjk745/ai-police-sketches" target="_blank">Developers Created AI to Generate Police Sketches. Experts Are Horrified</a></br>Police sketch AI-rtist, created by developers Artur Fortunato and Filipe Reynaud is raising concerns about the potential for AI to worsen existing racial and gender biases present in initial witness descriptions. AI experts and researchers warn that this technology can be dangerous, as it may lead to false or misleading forensics, leading to wrongful convictions. This technology, combined with the already unreliable process of witness descriptions, could place suspicion on already over-criminalized populations.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.asc.upenn.edu</i>: <a href="https://www.asc.upenn.edu/news-events/news/americans-dont-understand-what-companies-can-do-their-personal-data-and-thats-problem" target="_blank">Americans Don’t Understand What Companies Can Do With Their Personal Data — and That’s a Problem</a></br>This new survey of 2,000 Americans has revealed that most do not understand the data collection and marketing policies of online companies and feel powerless to stop them. It showed that the majority do not even understand the term "privacy policy" and fear the potential harm their data can cause. Additionally, the survey revealed that the majority of Americans would have received an "F" if they had taken a quiz on internet marketing practices and policies. The researchers suggest that Congress should act now to regulate how companies can use personal information, and the onus should be shifted from individuals to companies.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.whitehouse.gov</i>: <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/02/07/fact-sheet-in-state-of-the-union-president-biden-to-outline-vision-to-advance-progress-on-unity-agenda-in-year-ahead/" target="_blank">FACT SHEET - In State of the Union, President Biden to Outline Vision to Advance Progress on Unity Agenda in Year Ahead</a></br>President Biden announced a four-part Unity Agenda during his first State of the Union address, focusing on ending cancer as we know it, delivering on the sacred obligation to veterans, tackling the mental health crisis, and beating the opioid and overdose epidemic. The President called on Congress to act to end cancer as we know it and urged them to reauthorize the National Cancer Act and lock in the strong investment in cancer research passed in 2016. He also announced plans to provide patient navigation support to every American facing cancer and take steps to help people avoid smoking. Additionally, he called for investment in ARPA-H to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and other diseases. Finally, he plans to reduce veteran suicide and deliver more benefits and health care more quickly to more veterans than ever before.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4286147" target="_blank">Using Terms and Conditions to Apply Fundamental Rights to Content Moderation</a> by João Pedro Quintais, Naomi Appelman, and Ronan Fahy. This paper examines how the Digital Services Act (DSA) of the European Union will affect the enforcement of terms and conditions (T&Cs) on online platforms. Article 14 of the DSA requires platforms to have "due regard" to the fundamental rights of users under the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. The authors argue that this provision can establish the indirect horizontal effect of fundamental rights in the relationship between platforms and their users.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's February 8th, 2023.</p>

<p>Today, we'll be exploring the history of DoNotPay, the Mastodon bump that's become a slump, and a Design Patent Examiner job opening. Techdirt has the scoop on DoNotPay, and why it's claims may not be as valid as they appear. We'll also take a look at the Mastodon open source platform and the obstacles it faces when it comes to user growth. Plus, if you're in the market for a job, we have the perfect opportunity for you! The U.S. Patent and Trademark office is looking for Design Patent Examiners, so tune in to find out more! It's all coming up, next! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.techdirt.com</i>: <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/02/07/heres-the-article-we-didnt-run-back-in-2017-about-donotpay/" target="_blank">Here’s The Article We Didn’t Run Back In 2017 About DoNotPay</a></br>This article explores the history of DoNotPay, a startup created by Josh Browder as a teenager, and the questionable claims he has made since its launch. In the past, Browder has resisted providing data to validate his claims, but recent research by Kathryn Tewson has revealed some discrepancies. The article also discusses a draft article about DoNotPay that was written five years ago, but was never published.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.wired.com</i>: <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-mastodon-bump-is-now-a-slump/" target="_blank">The Mastodon Bump Is Now a Slump</a></br>Active users of the open source microblogging platform Mastodon have fallen by more than 1 million since the surge in sign-ups following the takeover of Elon Musk's Twitter last October. Despite its promise as an independent alternative to mainstream social media, many newcomers have complained that Mastodon is difficult to use. The platform's admins have worked hard to get servers back online and added content moderation policies to handle the influx of new users. The platform is now back to being manageable, though the legal burden on Mastodon server admins may soon increase if Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act is weakened or eliminated.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.usajobs.gov</i>: <a href="https://www.usajobs.gov/job/686135400" target="_blank">Design Patent Examiner </a></br>This job announcement from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is open to U.S. citizens and nationals. The position is a Design Patent Examiner, with a salary range of $61,325 to $79,722 per year. The physical worksite for this position is in Alexandria, Virginia, however the duties may be performed throughout the United States and Puerto Rico. The duties involve evaluating patent applications and determining whether patents can be granted for inventions. New patent examiners receive top-notch training upon hiring, and the position requires a background investigation and fingerprint check. Applicants must meet the United States Office of Personnel Management's qualification requirements for the advertised position.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4349023" target="_blank">Familial Searches, The Fourth Amendment, and Genomic Control</a> by Jacob S. Sherkow, Natalie Ram and Carl Gunter. This essay examines how police are increasingly using consumer genomic databases to solve crimes, such as long-cold serial killings and assaults, without judicial oversight and the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement. It then outlines a novel technology that would allow users to engage in genomic analysis securely, while ensuring that Fourth Amendment protections are upheld.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's February 7th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to the news of today. In Washington, D.C. a federal judge is considering if the Constitution guarantees a right to abortion, separate from the Supreme Court's ruling on Roe v. Wade. Meanwhile, in Vallejo, California, senior officials have been accused of ordering the destruction of evidence from police shootings. And finally, a letter in the New Yorker challenges the idea that 3-D printing can solve the U.S. homelessness crisis. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.politico.com</i>: <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/02/06/federal-judge-constitutional-right-abortion-dobbs-00081391" target="_blank">Federal judge says constitutional right to abortion may still exist, despite Dobbs</a></br>A federal judge in Washington, D.C. has suggested that there may be a constitutional right to abortion baked into the 13th Amendment, which would be a separate right from that of the 14th Amendment addressed by the Supreme Court in its decision to overturn Roe v. Wade last year. The judge has asked the parties in a criminal case involving charges of blocking access to abortion clinics to present arguments on the issue. The question remains if any other provision of the Constitution could confer a right to abortion, which could potentially be the final pronouncement on the issue.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>openvallejo.org</i>: <a href="https://openvallejo.org/2023/02/05/vallejo-destroyed-evidence-of-police-killings/" target="_blank">Senior officials ordered destruction of Vallejo police shooting evidence</a></br>The city of Vallejo destroyed multiple pieces of evidence from police shootings and one non-fatal shooting in January 2021, against city policy and potentially in violation of the city's agreement with the California Department of Justice. Documents requested by Open Vallejo appear to show Assistant City Attorney Katelyn Knight authorizing the destruction of evidence, although the City Attorney later claimed the purge had not been officially approved. Open Vallejo has asked the judge overseeing the lawsuit to consider referring the matter for criminal prosecution.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.newyorker.com</i>: <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/02/13/letters-from-the-february-13-and-20-2023-issue" target="_blank">Fit to Print?</a></br>A letter in the New Yorker  suggests that 3-D printing is unlikely to solve the U.S. homelessness crisis, as the problem is primarily rooted in legal infrastructure, not physical infrastructure. Meanwhile, architects suggest that the material of choice for 3-D printing, concrete, has several drawbacks, including low R-value and increased susceptibility to seismic failure.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4327890" target="_blank">User-Generated Content Shapes Judicial Reasoning: Evidence From a Randomized Control Trial on Wikipedia</a> which was written by Neil Thompson, Xueyun Luo, Brian McKenzie, Edana Richardson and Brian Flanagan. This paper discusses how user-generated content, such as Wikipedia articles, are used to influence legal judgments and how this could have an effect on the judicial system. Through a randomized control trial, the paper shows that the presence of a Wikipedia article about Irish Supreme Court decisions makes it more likely that the corresponding case will be cited as a precedent by judges in subsequent decisions. Additionally, the language used in the Wikipedia article also influences the language used in judgments. The paper encourages greater attention to be paid to ensuring that user-generated content contains the highest quality of information.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's February 6th, 2023.</p>

<p>Max here, bringing you the latest news from around the world. Big news today: the US economy has seen some huge gains, with a 3.4% unemployment rate and 517,000 new jobs in January. President Biden is celebrating, and it looks like his economic plans are paying off. On the music front, we're looking at why modern pop songs often have so many credited writers, and why that can be a contentious issue. And finally, everyone's favorite social media app, Mastodon, has a new app to help keep you up to date with the latest events. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>news.feedseer.com</i>: <a href="https://news.feedseer.com/welcome" target="_blank">FeedSeer News for Mastodon</a></br>Stay up to date with the latest events being discussed by your friends with FeedSeer News! This app allows you to see the most popular links that have appeared in your Mastodon feed over the past day, along with preview text and pictures. All you need to do is authorize the app to have read access to your feed and you're good to go!</p>

<p>Next, from <i>tedium.co</i>: <a href="https://tedium.co/2023/02/04/why-do-modern-pop-songs-have-so-many-credited-writers/" target="_blank">Why Do Modern Pop Songs Have So Many Credited Writers?</a></br>This article examines the recent trend of modern songwriting, which often involves aggressive credit-grabbing, even when the person did not contribute to the song's composition. The article looks at a tweet from Diane Warren, who asked why Beyonce's song "Alien Superstar" had 24 songwriters listed. The article explains that samples and interpolations of other pieces require songwriter credits, but even when those are removed, there is still a substantial increase in the amount of songwriters listed. The article further examines the reasons for this trend, including money, the computer, and the changing definition of songwriting.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.politico.com</i>: <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/02/03/biden-on-jobs-numbers-the-critics-and-cynics-are-wrong-00081084" target="_blank">Biden on robust jobs numbers: The ‘critics and cynics are wrong’ </a></br>President Joe Biden celebrated the latest jobs report showing a 3.4 percent unemployment rate, the lowest since May 1969, saying that the "Biden economic plan is working." The economy created 517,000 jobs in January, which Biden described as a "blowout" jobs report. The report also arms the White House with a line of defense against Republican attacks over Biden's spending policies. Inflation remains an issue, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell is working to get inflation down to the central bank's target range of 2 percent.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3340960" target="_blank">Infringement, Unbound</a> by Sarah R. Wasserman Rajec. This paper argues that patent infringement doctrines which allow for expanded liability beyond the normal bounds of patent enforcement should be seen as a complement to the boundaries governing patent scope instead of a risk to the delicate balance of patent law. This article examines the requirements set forth by the patent in terms of subject matter, term, and scope and how recent enforcement rules have loosened them, such as by holding manufacturers and retailers liable for the infringement of their customers as “indirect” infringers. It argues for reform of patent infringement doctrines and that any changes must be moored to the same fundamental purposes that motivate the delicate balance patent law seeks.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's February 5th, 2023.</p>

<p>Good evening everyone! It's Max here with all the news that's fit to be streamed. Today, we take a look at the media's treatment of Sam Bankman-Fried, the thirty-year-old accused of running a cryptocurrency trading platform. We'll also cover the EU and US coming together to cooperate on Artificial Intelligence research and how conservative politicians are trying to censor ideological discussion in the classroom. So stay tuned for the latest news on the world of tech and politics! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>newsletter.mollywhite.net</i>: <a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/p/sam-bankman-fried-is-not-a-child" target="_blank">Sam Bankman-Fried is not a child </a></br>This article discusses the media's treatment of thirty-year-old Sam Bankman-Fried. Despite his age, he has been described by the media and public as a "boy genius," a "wunderkind," and a "whiz kid." He is currently on house arrest after the collapse of his cryptocurrency trading platform, FTX. The article argues that SBF is being given the benefit of the doubt that other accused criminals are not, due to his image, privilege, and the perception that he is still a child. It suggests that while young Black children are often adultified, Bankman-Fried is being infantilized by the media, and this could influence the public's perception of his culpability.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.euractiv.com</i>: <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/artificial-intelligence/news/eu-us-step-up-ai-cooperation-amid-policy-crunchtime/" target="_blank">EU, US step up AI cooperation amid policy crunchtime</a></br>European and US leaders have signed an agreement to cooperate on Artificial Intelligence research. The agreement was signed in the context of the EU-US Trade and Technology Council and is part of an effort to reach a common approach on trustworthiness and risk management for AI technology. Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton stated that researchers from both sides will join forces to develop socially beneficial applications of AI.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.theguardian.com</i>: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/04/conservatives-ron-desantis-florida-education?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other" target="_blank">Conservatives angry about school ‘indoctrination’ are telling on themselves</a></br>This article discusses the attempts by Florida's Republican Governor Ron DeSantis to suppress critical race theory in the state's educational curriculum, as well as his and other conservative politicians' attempts to promote a patriotic vision of America and censor ideological discussion in the classroom. It argues that this crusade undermines the purpose of education which is to enable citizens to be fearless and critical, and that it is authoritarian in nature. The article also suggests that educators are intimidated by these initiatives, and that the current climate is damaging US democracy.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4181948" target="_blank">Uncommon Carriage</a> by Blake E. Reid. This article challenges the coherence of “common carriage” as a field and its utility for assessing the constitutionality and policy wisdom of Internet regulation. It assesses the post-Civil War history of common carriage regimes in telecommunications law, and disentangles talismanic invocations of “common carriage” by isolating three distinct questions. The article argues for a context-sensitive approach to Internet regulations that evaluates the designation of carriers, the imposition of rules, and the role of the First Amendment on a granular basis that more seriously accounts for the complexity of contemporary Internet platforms.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's February 4th, 2023.</p>

<p>Hey, everyone! It's Max here with a roundup of the hottest stories of the day. First up, talc and Twitter have been in the news, with a court ruling on talc products and Twitter ending free access to its API. Next, Harvard's Technology and Social Change Project is shutting down in 2024 due to a policy change. Finally, WIPIP is discussing the legal implications of midcentury modern design and how to separate utility patents and design patents. Don't miss out on the latest developments on these stories – stay tuned! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>zencastr.com</i>: <a href="https://zencastr.com/z/OPHESHOp" target="_blank">Space Karen and the Scummy Texas Two-Step </a></br>In this episode of Esquiring Minds, a recent court ruling has thrown out a bankruptcy case filed by Johnson & Johnson regarding its talc products. This comes on the heels of news that Twitter will be ending free access to its API and a legal AI bot company which has been mocked, prompting a ban on people testing its services.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.washingtonpost.com</i>: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/02/02/misinformation-harvard-donovan-close/" target="_blank">Joan Donovan's misinformaton project at Harvard will close in 2024 - The Washington Post</a></br>Harvard University has announced the closure of the Kennedy School of Government's Technology and Social Change Project, which has studied online misinformation since 2019, due to a school policy requiring faculty members to lead such an undertaking. The project's director, Joan Donovan, a widely cited expert on digital "media manipulation," is not a faculty member and could not continue. This closure comes as the field of study into misinformation and access to data is undergoing changes, with Twitter announcing it will begin charging for automated access and other platforms such as TikTok, Discord, and Twitch presenting new challenges for data gathering.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>tushnet.blogspot.com</i>: <a href="http://tushnet.blogspot.com/2023/02/wipip-concurrent-session-1-design.html" target="_blank">Rebecca Tushnet's 43(B)log: WIPIP, Concurrent Session #1, Design</a></br>This WIPIP concurrent session discussed the issues surrounding midcentury modern design, including the legal implications of replicating designs, the debate surrounding the idea of authenticity and its role in product design, and how the term "iconic" is used in brands and in wider culture. It also addressed the differences between utility patents and design patents and how separating them could help to resolve inconsistencies.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4342652" target="_blank">Legislative Constitutionalism & Federal Indian Law</a> by Maggie Blackhawk. This article explores the diminishing role of the U.S. Supreme Court in constitutional law making and its growing dominance over constitutional interpretation. The article suggests that federal Indian law may offer a unique perspective on how the other branches of government can play a more significant role in making and interpreting constitutional law.</p>

<p>It's February 3rd, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to the latest news roundup! Twitter's internal shake-up has led to concerns over the security of direct messages, and people should be aware of their rights when requesting erasure. Meanwhile, the case of Tyre Nichols has sparked a narrative from the right that may not be accurate. And finally, the Justice Department and a technology industry group have both thrown their support behind the proposal for a design patent bar. Stay tuned. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>michae.lv</i>: <a href="https://michae.lv/deleting-dms-from-twitter/" target="_blank">Deleting DMs from Twitter using the GDPR</a></br>Twitter's Chief Information Security Officer, Chief Privacy Officer, Chief Compliance Officer and head of Trust and Safety have all resigned this week, leaving engineers to self-certify compliance with FTC requirements and other laws. This has sparked concerns around the security of direct messages, which are not end-to-end encrypted, leading to questions around data safety and the right to erasure. People can make an erasure request to Twitter via a confidential reporting form, and should set a calendar reminder for 1 month’s time to follow up if they have not received a response.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>radleybalko.substack.com</i>: <a href="https://radleybalko.substack.com/p/tyre-nichols-wasnt-murdered-because" target="_blank">Tyre Nichols wasn't murdered because of "affirmative action" </a></br>In response to the death of Tyre Nichols in Memphis, a narrative has been circulating on the right claiming that the officers involved with his death were only hired due to lax hiring standards related to race. However, an investigation into their hiring records has revealed that two of the officers may have met the pre-existing standards and the other three were hired before the more relaxed standards were implemented. Furthermore, the new police budget in Memphis has increased funding and given officers raises, making the defunding the police narrative moot.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.law360.com</i>: <a href="https://www.law360.com/ip/articles/1565768?nl_pk=fd062d42-234e-4b6a-b9b5-4052fd7ef7ac&" target="_blank">Design Patent Bar At USPTO Draws Many Supporters - Law360</a></br>Design Patent Bar At USPTO Draws Many Supporters: The Justice Department's Antitrust Division, a technology industry group and others have thrown their support behind a proposal to create a separate design patent bar at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, while two key intellectual property groups have pushed back on the idea. The proposal was backed by the American Bar Association and the American Intellectual Property Law Association and opposed by the Intellectual Property Owners Association.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4315919" target="_blank">Effects of Illinois' 36% Interest Rate Cap on Small-Dollar Credit Availability and Financial Well-being</a> written by J. Brandon Bolen, Gregory Elliehausen and Thomas Miller. The paper focuses on the effects of a binding interest-rate cap imposed on loans under $40,000 from non-bank and non-credit-union lenders. Using credit bureau data from Illinois and a neighboring state without an interest-rate cap, the authors find that the cap decreased the number of loans to subprime borrowers by 44 percent and increased the average loan size to subprime borrowers by 40 percent. An online survey of Illinois' short-term, small-dollar-credit borrowers revealed that most were unable to borrow money when needed following the imposition of the interest-rate cap and only 11 percent reported that their financial well-being improved following the interest-rate cap. The paper concludes that due to the interest-rate cap, the availability of small-dollar credit decreased significantly, particularly to subprime borrowers, and worsened the financial well-being of many consumers.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's February 2nd, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's news. We've got a lot of stories for you so let’s jump right into it. First off, the Justice Department is looking into Tesla's self-driving technology following reports of 35 crashes and 14 deaths. Then, we'll take a look at the battle over free speech in Florida, where three laws are leading to changes in schools. Finally, the CFPB is proposing a rule to rein in excessive credit card late fees. All that and more, so stay tuned! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/31/technology/tesla-autopilot-investigation.html" target="_blank">Tesla’s Self-Driving Technology Comes Under Justice Dept. Scrutiny</a></br>The Justice Department is investigating Tesla's self-driving technology. The requests for documents relate to Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features, which allow cars to operate autonomously but require oversight by a human driver. Tesla has received 35 crash reports involving Autopilot, 9 of which resulted in 14 deaths. Tesla has said no wrongdoing has been determined and that any enforcement action could have a significant impact on finances.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.lawdork.com</i>: <a href="https://www.lawdork.com/p/floridas-war-on-school-speech-a-law" target="_blank">Florida's war on school speech, a Law Dork Q&A</a></br>Florida has been in the news recently due to Governor Ron DeSantis and the Republican project to restrict certain types of discussions in schools, such as race, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Three laws, the Stop WOKE Act, the “Don’t Say Gay” law, and H.B. 1467, are leading to a lot of changes in the state, such as empty library shelves and canceled courses. Jerry Edwards, a staff attorney with the ACLU of Florida, is part of the team challenging part of the Stop WOKE Act in court and spoke to Law Dork about the Stop WOKE Act litigation and other free speech questions being raised in the state. Edwards said that while the job security is guaranteed, he would rather not have it because the governments of the United States and Florida are violating people's rights. The case is currently set for trial in 2023 and the state is appealing the injunction against the Stop WOKE Act, which would allow the state to enforce the law if the appeal is successful.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.consumerfinance.gov</i>: <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-proposes-rule-to-rein-in-excessive-credit-card-late-fees/" target="_blank">CFPB Proposes Rule to Rein in Excessive Credit Card Late Fees</a></br>Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau proposed a rule to close a loophole exploited by credit card companies to hike fees with inflation. The proposed rule could save families billions of dollars and help ensure that over the top late fees are illegal. The proposed rule would lower the immunity provision for late fees to $8 for a missed payment, end the automatic annual inflation adjustment, and cap late fees at 25% of the consumer’s required payment. Comments must be received on or before April 3, 2023, or within 30 days after publication of the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the Federal Register, whichever is later.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2801672" target="_blank">Conflicts & Capital Allocation</a> written by Benjamin Edwards. The paper argues that the current regulatory structure for financial advice incentivizes financial advisors to manipulate and deceive retail investors, negatively affecting capital allocation throughout the economy. To address this issue, the paper suggests that an effective policy response should focus on compensation incentives and limit conflicts of interest.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's February 1st, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to the news roundup! First, we're discussing redistricting litigation across the U.S., and how it could impact the control of Congress in 2024. Then, we're saying farewell to the iconic Boeing 747, which has been around for over five decades. Finally, we're noting the University of Texas School of Law's call for papers for their eighth annual Administrative Law New Scholarship Roundtable. Stay tuned to get the details on all of these stories! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.democracydocket.com</i>: <a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/opinion/redistricting-lawsuits-could-impact-control-of-congress/" target="_blank">Redistricting Lawsuits Could Impact Control of Congress</a></br>Redistricting litigation across the U.S. could significantly impact the control of Congress in the 2024 election. According to a new report from Democracy Docket, more than half of the states with multiple congressional seats have already been involved in redistricting litigation, and 70% of those cases are ongoing. Six of the ten most populous states still have litigation over their congressional maps, with potential for a double-digit seat swing either way. Racial discrimination remains the major theme of these lawsuits, with more than half of the redistricting cases containing claims of racial discrimination or violation of the Voting Rights Act. The outcome of these cases could be decisive in determining the speaker's gavel in 2025.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.cbsnews.com</i>: <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/boeing-747-queen-of-the-skies-flying-off-history/" target="_blank">Boeing 747, the "Queen of the Skies," flying off into history</a></br>Boeing's iconic 747 airplane, the "Queen of the Skies," is flying off into history after more than five decades of transporting passengers, astronauts, and cargo around the world. CBS News was there as Vic Anderson, the lead mechanic on the last 747, took his dad, Andy, who was a supervisor on the prototype, to see the final assembly of the plane. After building 1,574 747s, Boeing will deliver the very last one on Tuesday to Atlas Air. Vic Anderson said he never thought he would outlast the famous plane.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.yalejreg.com</i>: <a href="https://www.yalejreg.com/nc/call-for-papers-eighth-annual-administrative-law-new-scholarship-roundtable/" target="_blank">Call for Papers: Eighth Annual Administrative Law New Scholarship Roundtable - Yale Journal on Regulation</a></br>The University of Texas School of Law is pleased to host the eighth annual Administrative Law New Scholarship Roundtable on May 16-17, 2023. Scholars wishing to present a paper and participate in the Roundtable should submit a one-to-two-page abstract by Wednesday, February 1. The Roundtable is an opportunity for approximately twelve authors to workshop their papers in a series of individual sessions, one for each paper, over the course of a day and a half. The University of Texas School of Law will provide meals and lodging for two nights at the University’s AT&T Conference Center. Scholars must have less than ten years of tenure-track teaching to be eligible to submit.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3906001" target="_blank">Disorderly Content</a> written by Ari Ezra Waldman. This paper is a contribution to the sociolegal literature as it approaches content moderation from an explicitly queer perspective. It argues that platforms are recreating for the digital age structures of control that have long been used to police public expression of queer sexuality. The paper details and challenges the current content moderation literature and explores potential new directions for scholarship, moderation, and law.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's January 31st, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's news roundup! We have a statement from US law professors about proposed legal reforms in Israel, an incident involving a Molotov cocktail being thrown at a synagogue in New Jersey, and a booklist of 10 books to add to your collection and share with readers in honor of Black History Month.  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>uslawprofstatementisrael.com</i>: <a href="https://uslawprofstatementisrael.com/" target="_blank">US Law Professors' Statement About the Proposed Law Reforms in Israel</a></br>This article discusses the opposition from a large group of law professors in the United States to the effort by the current Israeli government to drastically overhaul the country's legal system. The proposed reforms would grant the ruling coalition absolute power to appoint justices and judges and severely limit judicial review of executive-branch decisions and curtail the independence of the Attorney General and legal advisers. The signatories of the article express their worry that the reforms would weaken the independence of the judiciary, the separation of powers, and the rule of law, which have been instrumental in helping Israel flourish over the past 75 years.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/29/nyregion/arson-temple-ner-tamid-new-jersey.html" target="_blank">Molotov Cocktail Hurled at a New Jersey Synagogue, Police Say</a></br>A man wearing a ski mask lit a Molotov cocktail and threw it at the front door of a synagogue in Bloomfield, New Jersey early on Sunday morning. Fortunately, the synagogue, Temple Ner Tamid, was undamaged, and the fire went out on impact. In addition, an incident at an Episcopal church in Asbury Park, NJ is also under investigation for possible bias. The Bloomfield Police Department is offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to an arrest, and the synagogue is expecting an increased police presence in the coming days. The Anti-Defamation League of New York and New Jersey has reported a spike in antisemitic incidents and threats against synagogues in New Jersey.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.libraryjournal.com</i>: <a href="https://www.libraryjournal.com/story/Black-History-Month-10-Books-To-Add-to-the-Collection-and-Share-with-Readers-2022" target="_blank">Black History Month: 10 Books To Add to the Collection and Share with Readers</a></br>This Black History Month booklist features a range of essential works of fiction and nonfiction that celebrate African American culture and experiences. The books on this list, written by both debut and experienced authors, cover a wide variety of topics, such as poetry, trauma, enslavement, freedom, civil rights, ongoing obstacles for Black people, triumphs, justice, and workplace successes. Readers can access a downloadable list of these titles and a copy of the page for posting and sharing. Additionally, readers can get print or digital editions of the list with a subscription.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3810924" target="_blank">Beyond Republicans and the Disapproval of Regulations: A New Empirical Approach to the Congressional Review Act</a> by Steven J. Balla, Bridget C.E. Dooling, and Daniel R. Pérez. The paper focuses on the use of Congressional Review Act as an instrument of position taking for legislators of both political parties. It analyses an original data set of all resolutions disapproving of agency regulations introduced over a twenty-six-year period to demonstrate that Democrats make regular use of the CRA and that resolutions are consistently pursued outside of presidential transitions.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's January 30th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's top stories! In Minnesota, a new law has been passed that guarantees the right to abortions. We'll take a look at how this law came to be and what it means for the state. And in other news, we'll discover why people believe in conspiracy theories – is it sheer stupidity, or something more insidious? Finally, we'll examine the case of John Eastman, former Dean at Chapman University's Dale E. Fowler School of Law, who's facing disciplinary charges for his role in Donald Trump's attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. All that and more, coming up next! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>religionclause.blogspot.com</i>: <a href="http://religionclause.blogspot.com/2023/01/minnesota-passes-law-guaranteeing-right.html" target="_blank">Religion Clause: Minnesota Passes Law Guaranteeing Right To Abortions</a></br>Minnesota legislature has passed a bill that guarantees the right to abortions. The bill, the Protect Reproductive Options Act, was proposed to provide a secondary line of defense for abortion rights already guaranteed in the 1995 Minnesota Supreme Court decision, Doe v. Gomez. The bill now goes to Minnesota Governor Tim Walz for his signature, who has said he will sign it into law.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.businessinsider.com</i>: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-people-believe-conspiracy-theory-overconfidence-2023-1" target="_blank">Why people believe in conspiracy theories: plain old overconfidence</a></br>Conspiracy theories have been spreading like wildfire on social media platforms, with the majority of Americans believing at least one tale. New research has revealed that the common factor among those who believe in these theories is overconfidence. People think they are right all the time and are less likely to evaluate evidence critically. This arrogance is proving to be harder to stamp out than stupidity, so it is important to have faith in yourself without becoming too confident.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>terikanefield.com</i>: <a href="https://terikanefield.com/john-eastmans-its-a-political-witch-hunt-defense/" target="_blank">John Eastman's "It's A Political Witch Hunt" Defense </a></br>John Eastman, a former Henry Salvatori Professor of Law & Community Service and former Dean at Chapman University’s Dale E. Fowler School of Law, is facing disciplinary charges from the California State Bar for his role in Donald Trump's attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. The charges come after a bipartisan group filed a complaint against Eastman with the California State Bar in October 2021. The charges relate to Eastman's alleged violations of the code of professional responsibility for lawyers. If found guilty, Eastman could face disbarment.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4324090&dgcid=ejournal_htmlemail_intellectual:property:copyright:law:ejournal_abstractlink" target="_blank">Tattoos, Norms, and Implied Licenses</a> by Aaron Perzanowski. The essay considers the legal questions raised by the recent surge of tattoo copyright litigation, and its intersection with tattoo industry norms. Perzanowski argues that public displays, reproductions, and derivative works of tattoo designs employed to accurately depict the body of a tattooed person, fall under the scope of an implied license created by the expected bargain between the tattooer and their client. He further suggests that copyright assertions are inconsistent with the core purpose of tattooing as a social practice, and could lead to disruption of the industry's expectations, costs, and legal risks.</p>

<p>It's January 29th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's news roundup! A report from TechCrunch on how US police are using digital data to prosecute women for abortions. We'll take a look at a New York Times piece on how a drug company made $114 billion by gaming the US patent system. And we'll discuss how white America is offloading its failures onto civil rights movements.  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>techcrunch.com</i>: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/27/digital-data-roe-wade-reproductive-privacy/" target="_blank">How US police use digital data to prosecute abortions </a></br>Police in several states have used digital data to prosecute women for abortions in recent years. In some cases, police have obtained warrants to search digital devices to uncover conversations and evidence of abortion pills purchased online. In other cases, family members, friends or medical staff have notified authorities of suspected abortions. Despite a US Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade last summer, efforts to combat police use of digital data for abortion prosecutions are underway.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/28/business/humira-abbvie-monopoly.html" target="_blank">How a Drug Company Made $114 Billion by Gaming the U.S. Patent System </a></br>AbbVie has been exploiting the US patent system to keep generic versions of its blockbuster drug, Humira, off the market, allowing it to charge high prices and generating $114 billion in revenue since 2016. Next week, the monopoly is expected to end and prices are likely to drop. Patients have had to pay thousands of dollars out-of-pocket for the medication while AbbVie has profited and other pharmaceutical companies have followed its lead.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>sherrilyn.substack.com</i>: <a href="https://sherrilyn.substack.com/p/a-response-to-conor-friedersdorf" target="_blank">When White America Offloads its Failures on to Civil Rights Movements</a></br>Sherrilyn Ifill has written a response to the recent Atlantic newsletter from Conor Friedersdorf in which he claimed that “the Black Lives Matter approach” to ending police violence against Black people “has largely failed.” Ifill argues that it is wrong to blame the civil rights movement for the failure of white people to effectively confront and contain the manifestations of violent white supremacy. She notes that Black Lives Matter was first a call to action, a statement of demand for respect for Black people's humanity, and has since become the rallying cry and social media hashtag for Black people protesting police brutality. She further details the progress that has been made in terms of reforms to policing, and the broader movement to end police violence, and argues that the failure of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act was not the fault of the Black Lives Matter movement, but rather the lack of support from Republican Senators. Finally, she argues that the current system cannot be reformed and must be made over, and that the recent police response in Uvalde and lack of support for Capitol Police officers assaulted on January 6th has been a huge blow to law enforcement.</p>

<p>It's January 28th, 2023.</p>

<p>Hey there, it's Max! Today, a leak of phone numbers has revealed the use of intrusive spyware in Europe, threatening human rights. A new model called MusicLM has been released to generate high-fidelity music from text descriptions. And we remember Lt. Jack ReVelle, the man who saved North Carolina from nuclear disaster by disarming two hydrogen bombs.  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.coe.int</i>: <a href="https://www.coe.int/en/web/commissioner/-/highly-intrusive-spyware-threatens-the-essence-of-human-rights" target="_blank">Highly intrusive spyware threatens the essence of human rights - Commissioner for Human Rights</a></br>Over 18 months have since a leak of over 50,000 phone numbers, including those of many human rights defenders, journalists, academics, and opposition leaders, was exposed by an international coalition of investigative journalists. This leak revealed that the highly intrusive Pegasus spyware had been used to target these individuals, which has a chilling effect on other human rights and fundamental freedoms, such as freedom of expression and public participation. In order for Council of Europe member states to prevent grave human rights violations stemming from the use of such spyware, they must comply with their obligations under the European Convention and ensure that its use is lawful, legitimate, necessary, and proportionate.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>google-research.github.io</i>: <a href="https://google-research.github.io/seanet/musiclm/examples/" target="_blank">MusicLM: Generating Music From Text</a></br>This article introduces MusicLM, a model that generates high-fidelity music from text descriptions. Experiments show that it outperforms existing systems in audio quality and consistency. MusicCaps, a dataset of 5.5k text-music pairs provided by human experts, has also been released to support future research. MusicLM can additionally be conditioned on text and melody and is capable of generating audio from both painting descriptions and text prompts. It also has the ability to generate audio with different levels of diversity.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.ncrabbithole.com</i>: <a href="https://www.ncrabbithole.com/p/jack-revelle-goldsboro-nc-broken-arrow-obituary" target="_blank">An obituary for the man who saved North Carolina from nuclear disaster</a></br>On this day, January 26th, we remember Lt. Jack ReVelle, who disarmed two hydrogen bombs that had accidentally fallen near Goldsboro, North Carolina during the Cold War. On the night of January 23rd, 1961, a B-52 bomber suffered a fuel leak and broke apart, dropping two thermonuclear bombs. Lt. ReVelle and his explosive ordnance disposal team spent eight days in a muddy pit locating and defusing the bombs, holding the most radioactive part of the most powerful weapon the world had ever seen up against his chest for fifteen minutes. For decades, he couldn't tell anybody exactly what he'd done, until recently, when the story was declassified. Lt. ReVelle passed away on January 26th, 2020, after a long battle with a disease brought on by his military career. We remember him today for his courage and his commitment to protecting the people of North Carolina from nuclear disaster.</p>

<p>It's January 27th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to the news! In today's news, a mistrial has been declared in the civil case between rapper T.I. and members of his family and MGA Entertainment. Plus, a new documentary is exploring the lack of process to report Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's sexual assault allegations and the lack of accountability within the judicial appointment system. Finally, we explore the legal gaps which empower police to collect and store massive amounts of data with little regulation. Stay tuned for more news! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.lamag.com</i>: <a href="https://www.lamag.com/citythinkblog/mistrial-declared-in-t-i-s-toymaker-lawsuit-after-race-is-introduced/" target="_blank">Mistrial Declared in T.I.'s Toymaker Lawsuit After Race is Introduced</a></br>A mistrial was declared Wednesday in the civil case between rapper T.I. and members of his family and toy company MGA Entertainment. Judge James V. Selna declared the mistrial after a video deposition of a former MGA customer was played for the jury, which discussed the corporation's alleged appropriation of Black culture. MGA's lawyers had objected to the testimony, saying it was prejudicial against the company. Erin Ranahan, T.I.'s lawyer, said they had not objected to the ban on any racism talk during the trial and were surprised at the outcome. The mistrial has been declared and both parties are discussing the possibility of a second trial.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>slate.com</i>: <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/01/new-kavanaugh-documentary-what-it-will-do.html" target="_blank">New Kavanaugh Documentary: The film will do only one thing, and it is not great.</a></br>In the wake of Christine Blasey Ford's allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a new documentary, Justice, examines the lack of a process for citizens to report such allegations, and the lack of a neutral fact-finding entity to investigate them. Director Doug Liman and writer-producer Amy Herdy have now announced that they are restarting their investigation, with the film reverting back to a work in progress. However, even if new facts or evidence are revealed, there is still no formal political or legal engine to bring about accountability or change in the judicial appointment system.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.bostonreview.net</i>: <a href="https://www.bostonreview.net/articles/without-warrant/" target="_blank">Without Warrant: Yawning gaps in the law empower police to collect and store massive amounts of data, all on the grounds that it might one day turn out useful.</a></br>Recent technological advancements in law enforcement have raised questions about individual privacy and the lack of regulation on data collection. Police are now able to collect massive amounts of data by using geofencing, facial recognition databases, automated license plate readers, and predictive algorithms to identify potential suspects. According to two recent books, Virtual Searches and Predict and Surveil, the Fourth Amendment's protection against "unreasonable searches and seizures" often does not extend to these new forms of data collection. This has created an environment of virtually no checks on how law enforcement agencies use the data they collect. As privacy and civil liberties advocates call for more oversight, law enforcement agencies continue to embrace these new technologies.</p>

Charles's paper critiques the novel test, raises concerns about it, and suggests judicial and legislative responses.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's January 26th, 2023.</p>

<p>Good day, everyone! It's Max, bringing you the scoop on the latest news from around the world. First up, we've got a fascinating look at the world's first 'robot lawyer' and its potential implications for the legal world. We've also got an inside look at The New York Times Company and its various offerings, plus an announcement from Facebook about the end of the two-year suspension of Donald Trump's accounts. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.techdirt.com</i>: <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/01/24/the-worlds-first-robot-lawyer-isnt-a-lawyer-and-im-not-sure-its-even-a-robot/" target="_blank">The World’s First Robot Lawyer Isn’t A Lawyer, And I’m Not Sure It’s Even A Robot</a></br>This article examines the use of DoNotPay, an AI service that is advertised as a legal tool, but has been found to be inadequate and potentially damaging. After signing up for an account and using the service to generate legal documents such as a defamation demand letter, divorce settlement agreement and a small claims court lawsuit, the author found that the documents were of poor quality, did not consider legal nuances such as jurisdiction, and included inaccurate information.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/25/opinion/alec-baldwin-rust-5th-amendment.html" target="_blank">Opinion | Alec Baldwin Didn’t Have to Talk to the Police. Neither Do You. </a></br>Alec Baldwin is facing possible criminal charges for the death of a cinematographer on the set of the movie "Rust" in New Mexico in October 2021. Baldwin has admitted to talking to the police without an attorney present. Defense lawyers have said Baldwin's case should serve as a reminder for people involved in serious incidents to not talk to the police without legal representation. Prosecutors are accusing Baldwin of violating his legal responsibility to use the gun safely, which could incriminate him. Professor James Duane of Regent Law School has argued that people should exercise their right to remain silent, since it is difficult to navigate the dangers of talking to the police, and prosecutors may only present damaging statements from an interrogation.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>about.fb.com</i>: <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/01/trump-facebook-instagram-account-suspension/" target="_blank">Ending Suspension of Trump’s Accounts With New Guardrails to Deter Repeat Offenses (Meta)</a></br>We will be lifting the two-year suspension of former US President Donald Trump’s Facebook and Instagram accounts in the coming weeks, with new guardrails in place to deter repeat offenses. This decision follows the Oversight Board’s criticism of the suspension and the need for a more proportionate response. The organization determined that the risk to public safety has sufficiently receded, and that the two-year timeline should be adhered to. All public figures will face heightened penalties for repeat offenses, and posts that could contribute to risk may have their distribution limited or be removed.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4335905" target="_blank">ChatGPT Goes to Law School</a> by Jonathan H. Choi, Kristin E. Hickman, Amy Monahan, and Daniel Schwarcz. In this study, the authors used the widely publicized AI model ChatGPT to generate answers on four real exams at the University of Minnesota Law School. They found that over 95 multiple choice questions and 12 essay questions, ChatGPT performed on average at the level of a C+ student, achieving a low but passing grade in all four courses. The authors discussed the implications of their results for legal education and lawyering, as well as providing example prompts and advice on how ChatGPT can assist with legal writing.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's January 25th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to the news roundup! First up, artists are suing developers of AI tools over copyright infringement. But could their legal theories and facts be wrong? We'll explore. Next, we'll look at how the Friedman doctrine leads to the "enshittification" of all things. And finally, M&M's are making a radical change to their ads, replacing their cartoon characters with actress Maya Rudolph. Will it be enough to appease their critics? Stay tuned to find out! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>copyrightlately.com</i>: <a href="https://copyrightlately.com/artists-copyright-infringement-lawsuit-ai-art-tools/" target="_blank">Artists Attack AI: Why The New Lawsuit Goes Too Far</a></br>A group of artists has filed a first-of-its-kind copyright infringement lawsuit against the developers of popular AI art tools. The lawsuit alleges that AI-generated art is a threat to creative livelihoods, but its legal theories and facts may not be accurate. The lawsuit claims that AI tools are a "21st-century collage tool" that remixes the copyright works of millions of artists, but AI tools actually use training images to create entirely new works. The lawsuit also misrepresents how AI tools store images, and claims that all outputs of AI tools are derivative works, which is legally suspect.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.techdirt.com</i>: <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/01/24/how-the-friedman-doctrine-leads-to-the-enshittification-of-all-things/" target="_blank">How The Friedman Doctrine Leads To The Enshittification Of All Things</a></br>In a recent article exploring the "enshittification" of social media, Cory Doctorow outlines a process through which large companies eventually hit the "enshittification" stage. This process involves companies initially catering to their users in order to gain success, eventually having to pay back venture capitalists, and then struggling to please Wall Street with ever-increasing revenue and profit growth. Ultimately, this leads to companies seeking to capture all the value for themselves, in an effort to "maximize profits for shareholders" and appease Wall Street's short-term focus. As a result, companies may sacrifice long-term sustainability and profits, leading to users searching elsewhere.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/23/business/m-m-candy-controversy-tucker-carlson.html" target="_blank">Maya Rudolph Will Replace M&Ms Characters in Ads After Backlash</a></br>Mars Wrigley announced an indefinite pause from its “spokescandies,” cartoon characters that have been featured in the company’s ads for decades. This decision came after figures on the political right criticized the candy as “Woke M&M’s” because of cosmetic tweaks made in recent years. Mars Wrigley has decided to replace the spokescandies with actress and “Saturday Night Live” alum, Maya Rudolph. The decision has caused a controversy with Tucker Carlson of Fox News claiming that the candy is "unappealing and totally androgynous." M&M's has responded by saying that they are "all about bringing people together.”</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4334425" target="_blank">Defeating the Empire of Forms</a> by David A. Hoffman. For generations, contract scholars have tried to combat form contracts, which are seen as unread and full of terms that courts won't or shouldn't enforce. While these contracts have become a major part of modern commercial life, the article argues that their prevalence is itself an issue that requires a new diagnosis and reform. Hoffman proposes a statute of frauds which would make low-stakes written form contracts unenforceable. He argues that this would reduce the supply of cheap forms, externalize fewer harms, and protect important legal values.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's January 24th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's news roundup. We start off with an unprecedented case as a former high-level FBI official has been indicted on money laundering charges. In other news, a landmark free expression win has been granted to Lithuania's LGBTQI+ community, and we'll discuss Utah's plans to sue major social media companies over harms to children. So stay tuned for all the latest updates! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/23/nyregion/fbi-money-laundering-charles-mcgonigal.html" target="_blank">Former Top FBI Official in New York Charged in Money Laundering</a></br>Former high-level FBI official Charles McGonigal has been indicted in New York and Washington, D.C. on charges of taking money from a former foreign intelligence service agent and conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Russia by taking secret payments from a Russian oligarch, Oleg V. Deripaska. McGonigal had broken U.S. law by agreeing to help Deripaska attempt to get off the sanctions list and by investigating a rival oligarch. The charges are an unprecedented case and demonstrate that the reach of Russia’s oligarchs can extend into the heart of American law enforcement.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.article19.org</i>: <a href="https://www.article19.org/resources/lithuania-free-expression-lgbtqi/" target="_blank">Lithuania: landmark free expression win for LGBTQI+ community</a></br>Today, the European Court of Human Rights ruled in favour of Neringa Dangvydė Macaté, an openly gay children’s book author, whose fairy-tale book including stories of same-sex couples was marked with a warning label stating that the content ‘might have a negative effect on persons below the age of fourteen’. The Court found that placing the warning label violated freedom of expression of the author and access to information of children. This judgement is a landmark victory for the LGBTQI+ community in Lithuania and a strong statement against discrimination.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.ksl.com</i>: <a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/50563507/utah-plans-to-sue-social-media-companies-for-alleged-harms-to-children-teens" target="_blank">Utah plans to sue social media companies for alleged harms to children, teens </a></br>Utah Gov. Spencer Cox announced plans to sue major social media companies over the alleged harms to children, such as the potential damage to mental health and lack of parental controls. Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes said that lawsuits have yet to be filed, but the state is considering "any and all" claims against various platforms. Cox also asked that companies provide better parental controls, require age verification, and limit younger people from creating accounts.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4075153" target="_blank">A Free Press Without Democracy</a> written by Erin Carroll. The paper discusses how the press needs to better prepare themselves to resist and weather a turn to autocracy by overcoming certain pathologies such as American press exceptionalism, Darwinian in-group competition and an addiction to audience desire. It suggests implementing certain practices of press freedom to build resilience against autocratic regimes.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's January 23rd, 2023.</p>

<p>Greetings, citizens of the world! This is Max, bringing you the latest news. Today, we're looking at three different stories. The Supreme Court could threaten press freedoms established in the landmark case of New York Times v. Sullivan. We'll look at why a proposed federal bill could help protect these freedoms. We'll also be discussing the implications of deepfakes in the court system, and how school librarians across the country are facing restrictions on book orders. Be sure to tune in! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>slate.com</i>: <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2023/01/new-york-times-sullivan-supreme-court-defamation-law.html" target="_blank">New York Times v. Sullivan and freedom of the press is under threat from the Supreme Court.</a></br>This article discusses the importance of New York Times v. Sullivan, a landmark Supreme Court case from nearly 60 years ago. It established a precedent for the robust protection of free speech and press rights, but has recently been attacked by conservative legal figures and two current Supreme Court justices. The authors of the article propose a solution: the Freedom of Speech and Press Act, a federal bill that would codify the ruling of Sullivan and other press protections. The article further discusses the impact Sullivan has had on protecting speech, including protecting political cartoons and preventing the prosecution of journalists.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.counselmagazine.co.uk</i>: <a href="https://www.counselmagazine.co.uk/articles/deepfakes-in-the-courts" target="_blank">Deepfakes in the courts</a></br>This article explores the implications of deepfake evidence in legal cases, particularly in family law, criminal fraud, and banking authentication systems. It suggests that courts may need to increase the level of authentication required for video evidence and that duties of care might be imposed on lawyers and other professionals to have evidence verified by an independent forensic expert. Finally, it proposes increased sanctions for introducing false evidence.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.washingtonpost.com</i>: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/01/22/students-want-new-books-thanks-restrictions-librarians-cant-buy-them/" target="_blank">Students want new books. Thanks to restrictions, librarians can’t buy them.</a></br>School librarians across the United States are facing restrictions on book orders that have led to fewer books being available to students. Many states have passed laws giving parents more power over which books appear in libraries, while school districts have increased administrative or parental oversight of acquisitions. This has caused some students, especially those who are LGBTQ, to not be able to find books featuring characters like them. Those who support the more stringent book-purchasing guidelines argue that it will lead to more “pristine” school libraries, while others argue that it will lead to gaps in learning.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2380661" target="_blank">The Use and Abuse of Labor's Capital</a> and is written by David H. Webber. This article examines how public pension funds can invest against the economic interests of their own participants and beneficiaries and the legal implications of these investments. It focuses on the use of public pensions to fund privatization of public employee jobs, and the interpretation of the fiduciary duty of loyalty from ERISA and similar state pension codes. The article proposes that public pension funds be governed by a "member-first" view of fiduciary duty focused on the economic interests of public employees in their retirement funds.</p>

<p>It's January 22nd, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's news! In the Supreme Court inquiry, phones have been seized, and affidavits have been signed, but distrust remains. Meanwhile, many of the abortion bans enacted since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade include exceptions, but they're rarely granted. And finally, Suffolk University Law School is looking for a Fair Housing Test Coordinator to join their team and help identify and prevent housing discrimination.  And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/21/us/supreme-court-investigation.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare" target="_blank">Inside the Supreme Court Inquiry: Seized Phones, Affidavits and Distrust</a></br>The Supreme Court's investigation into the abortion opinion leak has caused disillusionment amongst current and former employees, and a lower public confidence in the Court. According to a report, 97 workers were interviewed, but the justices and their spouses weren't, until a statement was issued by the Court. Following the statement, public reaction was scathing. The Court was then forced to issue another statement, clarifying that the justices had in fact been questioned, but not in the same manner as other employees. This has further raised concerns about a double standard for the justices.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.nytimes.com</i>: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/01/21/us/abortion-ban-exceptions.html" target="_blank">Most Abortion Bans Include Exceptions. In Practice, Few Are Granted.</a></br>A review of state data and interviews with dozens of physicians, advocates and lawmakers has revealed that very few exceptions to the abortion bans enacted in about half the states since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade have been granted. Those unable to access abortions despite qualifying for an exception must travel to states where abortion is still broadly legal or obtain abortion pills at home. Doctors and hospitals are turning away patients, citing ambiguous laws and the threat of criminal penalties. Abortion opponents say the laws are working as intended, while abortion-rights advocates argue that legal exceptions do nothing but make abortion bans appear more reasonable than they really are.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>jobs.jobvite.com</i>: <a href="https://jobs.jobvite.com/suffolkuniversity/job/oPH9mfwL" target="_blank">Suffolk University Careers - Fair Housing Test Coordinator, Clinical Fellow</a></br>The Suffolk University Law School Housing Discrimination Testing Program is seeking an attorney for a remote full-time clinical fellowship position to coordinate fair housing testing designed to identify and prevent housing discrimination in thirteen communities throughout the WestMetro region. The successful candidate must be highly motivated, organized, and have a passion for civil rights and fair housing. This is a grant funded position for approximately two years, but may continue beyond that if additional funding becomes available. Suffolk University is an affirmative action, equal opportunity employer and especially encourages applications from historically marginalized or underrepresented groups.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1926162" target="_blank">Visual Invention</a> by Sarah Burstein. This article argues that the Federal Circuit's test for design patent nonobviousness is flawed and proposes changes to it.

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's January 21st, 2023.</p>

<p>Good day! Today we look at how Ron DeSantis is setting the terms for our understanding of him, a trio of artists suing AI image generators, and a confidential document that reveals the key human role in gunshot technology. Stay tuned! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.notesfromcalicomanor.com</i>: <a href="https://www.notesfromcalicomanor.com/2023/01/19/press-lets-desantis-define-himself/" target="_blank">Who sets the terms for our understanding of Ron DeSantis </a></br>This article examines the lack of journalistic coverage of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis before the publication of his upcoming book. The author suggests that without this background coverage, DeSantis is able to set the terms for the public's understanding of him. The article also features a list of useful pieces of coverage of DeSantis published prior to the book's release.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.buzzfeednews.com</i>: <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/ai-art-generators-lawsuit-stable-diffusion-midjourney" target="_blank">Meet The Trio Of Artists Suing AI Image Generators</a></br>This lawsuit is being brought against three companies - Stability AI, Midjourney, and DeviantArt - by three artists, Kelly McKernan, Karla Ortiz, and Sarah Andersen. The plaintiffs allege that Stable Diffusion, an AI model that allows anyone to generate professional quality images with a simple text prompt, was trained on billions of images scraped from the web without consent, including images owned by the trio of artists. A second suit by Getty Images has also been filed against Stability AI for allegedly copying and processing millions of images protected by copyright. If these suits are successful, it could significantly undermine the viability of tools like Stable Diffusion.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>apnews.com</i>: <a href="https://apnews.com/article/shotspotter-artificial-intelligence-investigation-9cb47bbfb565dc3ef110f92ac7f83862" target="_blank">Confidential document reveals key human role in gunshot tech </a></br>This news piece examines the use of artificial intelligence and human discretion by the company ShotSpotter to detect gunfire in 140 cities across the United States. The confidential document obtained by the Associated Press outlines how ShotSpotter employees overrule and reverse the algorithm's determinations to classify a sound as gunfire. Experts fear that the short time pressure and broad discretion given to ShotSpotter employees could lead to more false positives. The document was released from a protective order in a Chicago court case in which police and prosecutors used ShotSpotter data as evidence. ShotSpotter has long resisted calls to open its operations to independent scientific scrutiny.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4174200" target="_blank">Trial by Internet: A Randomized Field Experiment on Wikipedia’s Influence on Judges’ Legal Reasoning</a> by Neil Thompson, Brian Flanagan, Edana Richardson, Brian McKenzie and Xueyun Luo. This paper investigates the influence of Wikipedia articles on legal decisions, using a randomized field experiment to determine causal effects. The results of their experiment showed that Wikipedia shapes judicial behavior, with judges citing the relevant legal cases more often and talking about them in ways comparable to how the Wikipedia authors had framed them. This reveals a policy gap, as easily accessible, user-generated online content is already being relied on.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's January 20th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's news roundup! We've got the Supreme Court's investigation into the leak of a Roe v. Wade-overturning draft opinion, a seditious conspiracy trial involving the Proud Boys, and the Republican Party's embrace of dishonesty and fraud. Stay tuned for all the details! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.washingtonpost.com</i>: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/01/19/supreme-court-leak-roberts/" target="_blank">Supreme Court Dobbs leak: probe finds no hack, can't identify leaker </a></br>The Supreme Court announced Thursday that it was unable to identify the individual who leaked a draft opinion that overturned Roe v. Wade last spring. After months of investigation and interviews, no one confessed to publicly disclosing the document and none of the available evidence could identify any individual as the source of the document. The court also recommended new procedures and policies to address security lapses.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>terikanefield.com</i>: <a href="https://terikanefield.com/another-seditious-conspiracy-trial/" target="_blank">Another Seditious Conspiracy Trial </a></br>This trial is a big deal because it is the closest thing to a charge of treason that the US Constitution defines. Five defendants are on trial for seditious conspiracy and related felonies. Prosecutors say they were part of a "pro-Western fraternal organization" that called for the use of force against the government to oppose the lawful transfer of presidential power. They are accused of promoting violence on social media, encouraging members of their organization to attend a protest in Washington DC, and fundraising to support their activities. Charles Donohoe, the leader of the North Carolina chapter of the Proud Boys, has already pleaded guilty to Conspiracy and Assault Charges and is cooperating with the government's investigation.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.democracydocket.com</i>: <a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/opinion/santos-mccarthy-and-the-shameless-republican-party/" target="_blank">Santos, McCarthy and the Shameless Republican Party </a></br>Republican Party leaders have embraced dishonesty and fraud, exemplified by Representative George Santos, who lies without shame. The embrace of fraud and cheating by the Republican Party has led to a decline in shared decency, which is necessary for democracy to function. Representative Kevin McCarthy's recent appointment of Santos to two House committees shows that the party has no intention of restoring honor and dignity to their party.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3789156" target="_blank">Short Sellers, Short Squeezes, and Securities Fraud</a> by Christine Hurt and Paul J. Stancil. This paper explores the questions of when and whether short sellers and other atypical traders should benefit from the securities fraud class action structure. It looks at the modern securities fraud class action lawsuit and how the Supreme Court assumed that almost all investors purchase and sell securities based on their belief that the market price is accurate. The article creates a theoretical and normative framework for atypical investors in the securities fraud paradigm and examines the implications of short sellers becoming more and more visible in class actions.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's January 19th, 2023.</p>

<p>Hey there, it’s Max. Today, we’ve got a story about Governor Kathy Hochul of New York and her push to put a prosecutor on the state’s high court, despite pushback from within her own party. Then, we’re looking at OpenAI’s use of Kenyan workers on less than two dollars an hour. And finally, we’re exploring the House GOP’s ‘Weaponization of the Federal Government’ subcommittee, which looks like it won’t be a friend of free speech. It’s gonna be a wild one, so don’t miss it! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.lawdork.com</i>: <a href="https://www.lawdork.com/p/kathy-hochul-is-really-really-mad" target="_blank">Kathy Hochul is really, really mad Dem senators won't just put her prosecutor on New York's high court already</a></br>New York Governor Kathy Hochul is facing pushback from within her own party over her nomination of Hector LaSalle to serve on the state's Court of Appeals. Unions, abortion rights groups, and criminal justice progressives are among those opposing LaSalle, citing his decisions and lack of professional diversity. Despite this, Hochul has continued to press forward with the nomination and on Sunday made a speech in a Brooklyn church claiming that putting LaSalle's nomination to a vote was what Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. wanted. The Senate Judiciary Committee is set to consider the nomination Wednesday.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>time.com</i>: <a href="https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/" target="_blank">OpenAI Used Kenyan Workers on Less Than $2 Per Hour</a></br>This story examines how OpenAI, the San Francisco-based AI company, used Kenyan workers paid less than $2 per hour to build a safety mechanism for its AI chatbot, ChatGPT. This tool was needed to make ChatGPT less toxic, as its predecessor was prone to blurting out violent, sexist and racist remarks. OpenAI is now reportedly in talks with investors to raise funds at a $29 billion valuation. This story sheds light on the labor that goes into making AI-powered tools possible, and the precarious working conditions these workers face. [Editor's note: these summaries are made with the aid of the OpenAI's API]</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.techdirt.com</i>: <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/01/18/if-you-believe-in-free-speech-the-gops-weaponization-subcommittee-is-not-your-friend/" target="_blank">If You Believe In Free Speech, The GOP’s “Weaponization” Subcommittee Is Not Your Friend</a></br>The new Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, created by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, has been created to investigate the government’s relationship with Big Tech and to disrupt federal law enforcement investigations into Donald Trump’s interference in the 2020 election. Despite the name, this subcommittee is not fighting for free speech, but rather for the House GOP to weaponize its own authority and compel the federal government to go against the law. The hearings will likely be full of “yells and animal noises” of frustration and envy at being unable to exercise the power they crave.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4323277" target="_blank">The Right to Repair, Competition, and Intellectual Property</a> by Michael A. Carrier. This essay discusses the difficulties consumers often face when attempting to repair their products and how manufacturers have justified these restrictions by citing the need to protect their intellectual property. Carrier then explains why this justification is not persuasive.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's January 18th, 2023.</p>

<p>Max here with your top stories. Get ready for some shocking news about Tesla, a look at how social media platforms failed to address extremism, and a discussion about the dangers of spyware. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.reuters.com</i>: <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/tesla-video-promoting-self-driving-was-staged-engineer-testifies-2023-01-17/" target="_blank">Tesla video promoting self-driving was staged, engineer testifies</a></br>Tesla used a 2016 promotional video to overstate the capabilities of its self-driving technology, according to testimony from a senior engineer. The video had a tagline claiming the person in the driver's seat was only there for legal reasons and the car was driving itself, but the engineer said the video was meant to portray what was possible to build into the system and not what was available to customers at the time. Tesla faces legal and regulatory scrutiny over its driver assistance systems, and the US Department of Justice has launched a criminal investigation into the company's claims.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.washingtonpost.com</i>: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/01/17/jan6-committee-report-social-media/" target="_blank">What the Jan. 6 probe found out about social media, but didn’t report</a></br>This report found that social media platforms failed to address online extremism and calls for violence that preceded the Capitol riot, despite warnings from their employees. The House committee investigating the riot avoided detailed discussion in its report for fear of offending Republicans and tech companies. The report focused almost exclusively on Trump’s actions leading up to the riot, missing an opportunity to hold social media companies accountable.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.lawfareblog.com</i>: <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/lawfare-podcast-how-spy-your-pocket-threatens-end-privacy-dignity-and-democracy" target="_blank">The Lawfare Podcast: How a Spy in Your Pocket Threatens the End of Privacy, Dignity, and Democracy </a></br>This podcast episode features Laurent Richard and Sandrine Rigaud, the authors of Pegasus: How a Spy in Your Pocket Threatens the End of Privacy, Dignity, and Democracy. They discuss the investigative effort led by 17 international media organizations which exposed how some governments use the Pegasus spyware against journalists, human rights activists, political dissidents, and others. They talk about the operational security concerns, how they coordinated the international effort, and the impact of their work.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3852303" target="_blank">Secrecy's End</a> by Oona A. Hathaway. It examines the American system of national security secrecy and its impact on national security and the public. It explores the history of the classification system, its pathologies, and its failures. Ultimately, the article proposes ambitious yet feasible reforms to the system of secrecy.</p>

<p>Welcome to the news roundup! First, we’ll take a look at the tumultuous fallout of Twitterrific’s API shutdown and the need to explore open standards. Then, we’ll discuss the strain among the Supreme Court justices as they grapple with a deeply divided court. And finally, we’ll examine the use of AI artwork to avoid copyright infringement. Join me now for more of today’s stories! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>furbo.org</i>: <a href="https://furbo.org/2023/01/15/the-shit-show/" target="_blank">The [Crap] Show</a></br>The article discusses the experience of the creators of the Twitterrific app after the abrupt shutdown of the platform's API. It speaks to the struggle to cope with loss, as well as the lack of respect and dignity with which the shutdown occurred. The article also speaks to the need to explore new, open standards on the web, instead of relying on the whims of those running a "[Crap] show."</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.theatlantic.com</i>: <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/supreme-court-justices-public-conflict/672494/" target="_blank">The Supreme Court Justices Do Not Seem to Be Getting Along</a></br>The Supreme Court justices are showing signs of strain and tension in their collegial relationships, with disputes over the overturning of Roe v. Wade appearing to be the breaking point. Justices have traded barbs over the legitimacy of the court and there have been clear departures from the civility and collegiality of years past. During recent oral arguments, the justices have become increasingly acrimonious and impatient with one another, with some justices openly displaying a lack of respect.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>copyrightlately.com</i>: <a href="https://copyrightlately.com/using-ai-artwork-to-avoid-copyright-infringement/" target="_blank">Using AI Artwork to Avoid Copyright Infringement</a></br>This article explores the use of AI-generated art for license-free set decoration in motion pictures and other media productions. It examines the problem of copyright infringement when decorative items are used in a production and the resulting clearance culture. The article then looks at the potential of AI-generated art as a viable alternative, including copyright considerations and ethical and moral implications.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4188216" target="_blank">Warrantying Health Equity</a> by Heather Payne and Jennifer D. Oliva. This article discusses potential legal and policy reforms that could reign in sources of health-impairing air pollution, and proposes that the common law of property could be used to incentivize landlords to electrify. It argues that the use of typical gas appliances in leased spaces violates the implied warranty of habitability and, thereby, the common law of property.</p>

<p>It's January 16th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's news. First up, Aaron Perzanowski is exploring the relationship between tattoos and intellectual property norms in a new article titled "Tattoos & IP Norms." Then, the Joseph Saveri Law Firm and Matthew Butterick are leading a lawsuit against three companies that are using a generative AI-art tool called Stable Diffusion. Finally, a lawsuit has been filed against Voyager Labs, alleging that the company used over 38,000 fake Facebook accounts to collect data from over 600,000 users. Stay tuned for more updates on these stories as they unfold. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>scholarship.law.umn.edu</i>: <a href="https://scholarship.law.umn.edu/mlr/292/" target="_blank">"Tattoos & IP Norms" by Aaron Perzanowski</a></br>A new article by Aaron Perzanowski published in the Minnesota Law Review titled "Tattoos & IP Norms," explores the relationship between tattoos and intellectual property norms. It is now available for download on the Scholarship Repository at the University of Minnesota.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>stablediffusionlitigation.com</i>: <a href="https://stablediffusionlitigation.com/" target="_blank">Stable Diffusion litigation · Joseph Saveri Law Firm & Matthew Butterick</a></br>This is a story about a lawsuit filed against three companies: Stability AI, DeviantArt, and Midjourney. The lawsuit, brought by three artist plaintiffs, claims that the companies' use of a 21st-century collage tool called Stable Diffusion violates the rights of millions of artists. Stable Diffusion is an artificial intelligence software product that remixes copyrighted works of art without knowledge or consent of the creators. The lawsuit seeks to prevent the harm to the market for art and artists that could be caused by the proliferation of infringing images. [Editor's note: In this editor's opinion the framing of Stable Diffusion as a "col­lage tool" grossly mischaracterizes or misunderstands how the tool works. I will attempt to provide my arguments in an upcoming paper, but I fear lawsuits like this present a grave danger to future creators despite who they claim to support. Stay tuned!] </p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.theguardian.com</i>: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jan/12/meta-voyager-labs-surveillance-fake-accounts" target="_blank">Meta alleges surveillance firm collected data on 600,000 users via fake accounts</a></br>A lawsuit has been filed against Voyager Labs, an online surveillance company, for using Facebook and Instagram to collect user data. The suit alleges that Voyager created over 38,000 fake Facebook accounts to scrape data from over 600,000 users. It claims the company was using these accounts to predict future criminal activity. The complaint also states that Voyager hid its presence from Facebook and sold the data for profit. Facebook demanded that the LAPD cease use of any “dummy” accounts in November 2021. The lawsuit seeks to permanently ban Voyager Labs from accessing Facebook's sites, and also serve as a warning to other companies against engaging in similar activities.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4321211" target="_blank">Applying the Regulatory Report Card to Tax Regulations</a> by Bridget C.E. Dooling and Kristin E. Hickman. This essay recognizes and draws upon the Regulatory Report Card methodology, developed by Ellig and McLaughlin, to evaluate the quality of regulatory impact analysis published by federal government agencies in conjunction with notice-and-comment rulemaking. It also anticipates a forthcoming study of changes to tax regulatory practices as a result of a 2018 Memorandum of Agreement between the Treasury Department and the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. The essay offers a brief typology of tax regulations, as well as a few tax-specific adjustments to the Regulatory Report Card methodology.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's January 15th, 2023.</p>

<p>Today, we take a look at a judicial pick from New York Governor Kathy Hochul, the increasing rate of law enforcement deaths due to COVID-19, and the limitations of using artificial intelligence for contract drafting. Stay tuned as we unpack these stories. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>slate.com</i>: <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/01/kathy-hochul-hector-lasalle-prosecutor-corporate-lawyer.html" target="_blank">Kathy Hochul’s Terrible Judicial Pick Sends the Exact Wrong Message to Young Lawyers</a></br>New York Governor Kathy Hochul's nomination of Justice Hector LaSalle to replace Chief Judge Janet DiFiore on the New York State Court of Appeals is concerning. LaSalle's record on the Second Judicial Department of the Appellate Division includes decisions that hamper the state attorney general's investigation into anti-abortion clinics and open organizers up to liability for protected union activities. In addition, the nomination perpetuates a lack of professional diversity on the court, as prosecutors and corporate attorneys are already overrepresented. This lack of diversity deprives the court of valuable perspectives, which can have real-world impacts on criminal sentencing and employment disputes. The New York Senate should reject this nominee in favor of one that is better suited to represent New Yorkers' values.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>abcnews.go.com</i>: <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/covid-leading-cause-law-enforcement-deaths-2022-3rd/story?id=96363324" target="_blank">COVID was the leading cause of law enforcement deaths in 2022 for 3rd year in a row</a></br>COVID-19 remained the leading cause of law enforcement deaths in 2022 for the third year in a row, according to a new report released Wednesday by the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. The report found that 226 federal, state, tribal and local law enforcement officers died last year while in the line of duty, with 70 of those deaths linked to COVID-19. This is an 83% decline compared to the 405 officers who died from COVID-19-related complications in 2021. Firearms-related incidents were the second-highest cause of death in 2022, followed by traffic-related incidents and other. Texas had the highest number of law enforcement COVID-19 deaths with 16, followed by Illinois with six.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.adamsdrafting.com</i>: <a href="https://www.adamsdrafting.com/chatgpt-wont-fix-contracts/" target="_blank">ChatGPT Won't Fix Contracts - Adams on Contract Drafting</a></br>This article looks at the impact of ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence chatbot, on the legal profession's contract drafting process. While some have experimented with using it for contract drafting, the article argues that it would not lead to better drafting. Furthermore, ChatGPT would not provide the trustworthiness and reliability that comes from a legal expert, and AI has serious limitations for contract review. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of real expertise and a willingness to change in order to improve the contract process. [Editor's note: the above summary was written by the same large language model upon which ChatGPT is based—GPT-3.]</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4165724" target="_blank">The New Major Questions Doctrine</a> and was written by Daniel Deacon and Leah Litman. This article critically examines recent developments in the major questions doctrine and highlights the Court's new approach which operates as a clear statement rule, requiring explicit and specific congressional authorization for certain agency policies. The Court has increasingly relied on three new indicia of "majorness" to determine whether an agency rule is major. These include the political significance of or political controversy surrounding an agency policy, the novelty of a policy, and other, theoretically possible agency policies that might be supported by the agency’s broader statutory rationale.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's January 14th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome back to the newsroom! We've got three stories to cover today, starting with Dungeons & Dragons fans fighting corporate greed. Then, we'll report on professors protesting the nomination of Judge Hector LaSalle to New York state's highest court. Lastly, we'll look at the Anti-Twitter Files and what they show about Twitter's efforts to protect Trump and conservatives. So grab a seat, grab your dice, and get ready for some news! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>newrepublic.com</i>: <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/169978/dungeons-dragons-intellectual-property-greed" target="_blank">Dungeons & Dragons Fans Prepare to Face Their Greatest Adversary: Corporate Greed</a></br>A major overhaul of Dungeons & Dragons' Open Gaming License is reportedly set to be released later this year, and its changes could have major implications for the gaming industry. According to its reading of the new version, the license requires independent publishers to report their financial data to Wizards and gives the company the right to siphon off a portion of their revenue past a certain level. It also gives Wizards a “nonexclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, sub-licensable, royalty-free license to use that content for any purpose.” This has sparked a considerable backlash in the D&D community and could potentially fracture the RPG industry.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>amsterdamnews.com</i>: <a href="https://amsterdamnews.com/news/2023/01/12/professors-protest-nomination-of-lasalle/" target="_blank">Professors protest nomination of LaSalle</a></br>This article highlights the concerns of professors and co-directors of the Brooklyn Law School's Center for Criminal Justice regarding Governor Hochul's nomination of Judge Hector LaSalle to the state's highest court. They are concerned with his judicial track record on the rights of tenants, workers, and people seeking reproductive healthcare, as well as his lack of sound leadership in regards to transparency and accountability of prosecutors. They cite a federal lawsuit and a Supreme Court ruling in support of their claims.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.techdirt.com</i>: <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/01/13/the-anti-twitter-files-january-6th-committee-report-shows-how-twitter-leaned-over-backwards-to-protect-trump-conservatives/" target="_blank">The Anti-Twitter Files: January 6th Committee Report Shows How Twitter Leaned Over Backwards To Protect Trump & Conservatives</a></br>The House Select Committee's report on the January 6th insurrection has revealed that Twitter leaned over backwards to protect President Trump and conservatives in general. This is contrary to the popular narrative that the company was dominated by left-leaning censors, as the report found that concerns over political reprisals were more likely to stifle action than financial ones. Former Twitter employees revealed that executives were slow to recognize the risk Trump posed in inciting future violence, and the Trust & Safety team was blocked from implementing policies to address coded language for fear of a controversial crackdown on right-wing users. These findings debunk the notion that social media companies resisted taking proactive steps to limit the spread of violent and misleading content out of concern for their profit margins.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4321152" target="_blank">A Revisionist History of Products Liability</a> written by Alexandra D. Lahav. The paper examines the risks of relying on casebooks to determine what the common law was in the past. It argues that the traditional narrative about early products law is incorrect. The paper argues that manufacturers were liable for injuries caused by their products and that courts routinely ignored or rejected privity arguments. The paper has implications for how we view the development of the common law today.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's January 13th, 2023.</p>

<p>Today we are looking at some big stories. First up, the SEC has charged Genesis Global Capital and Gemini Trust Company for their unregistered offer and sale of crypto asset securities. Then, Special Counsel Jack Smith has subpoenaed Donald Trump’s former attorney Rudy Giuliani, as well as other witnesses close to Trump, to turn over records related to disbursements from the Save America PAC. Finally, ExxonMobil is under scrutiny after a new study revealed that the oil giant privately predicted global warming correctly but then spent decades publicly disputing the science. Stay tuned! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>www.sec.gov</i>: <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-7" target="_blank">SEC Charges Genesis and Gemini for the Unregistered Offer and Sale of Crypto Asset Securities through the Gemini Earn Lending Program</a></br>The Securities and Exchange Commission has charged Genesis Global Capital, LLC and Gemini Trust Company, LLC with the unregistered offer and sale of securities to retail investors through the Gemini Earn crypto asset lending program. The complaint alleges that Genesis and Gemini raised billions of dollars’ worth of crypto assets from hundreds of thousands of investors, and that, following volatility in the crypto asset market, investors were unable to withdraw their crypto assets. The SEC’s complaint alleges that the Gemini Earn program constitutes an offer and sale of securities under applicable law and should have been registered with the Commission.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>www.emptywheel.net</i>: <a href="https://www.emptywheel.net/2023/01/12/follow-the-money-break-the-attorney-client-wall-of-obstruction/" target="_blank">Follow the Money, Break the Attorney-Client Wall of Obstruction</a></br>Special counsel Jack Smith has subpoenaed Donald Trump’s former attorney Rudy Giuliani, as well as other witnesses close to Trump, to turn over records related to disbursements from the Save America PAC, Trump’s primary fundraising operation set up shortly after the 2020 election. The subpoena seeks documents related to Rudy’s retainer agreements, as well as documents related to other Trump entities such as the Make America Great Again PAC, the Save America Joint Fundraising Committee, and the Trump Make America Great Again Committee. The Justice Department is also investigating Sidney Powell’s alleged scam, as well as other attempts to silence witnesses.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.theguardian.com</i>: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/12/exxon-climate-change-global-warming-research" target="_blank">Exxon made ‘breathtakingly’ accurate climate predictions in 1970s and 80s</a></br>ExxonMobil is under scrutiny following a new study which has revealed that the oil giant privately predicted global warming correctly but then spent decades publicly disputing the science in an effort to protect its core business. The research found that the company's scientists accurately projected an upward curve of global temperatures and carbon dioxide emissions that nearly matches what has taken place. This further highlights the role of the oil industry in delaying action on climate change and its profound implications for people around the world.</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4321887" target="_blank">The New Judicial Power Grab</a> by Josh Chafetz. This essay looks into how the John Roberts-led judiciary has recently engaged in a striking power grab that goes unnoticed by scholars and public discourse. Chafetz considers the new judicial power grab in three distinct areas: election law, congressional oversight, and administrative law. The essay further looks into the dismissive rhetoric used by judges and how it has allowed them to amass a large amount of power at the expense of other governing institutions.</p>

<p>It's January 12th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's top stories! Today, we're discussing the impact of cryptocurrencies with Molly White and Jonathan Zittrain, the Finnish Parliament's rejection of the government's implementation of the Copyright in the Digital Single Market Directive, and the Institute for Responsive Government's Election Policy Progress Reports. So be sure to tune in and get the latest news on these fascinating topics! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <i>hls.harvard.edu</i>: <a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/events/web3-is-going-just-where-a-fireside-chat-with-molly-white-and-jonathan-zittrain/" target="_blank">Web3 Is Going Just Where? A fireside chat with Molly White and Jonathan Zittrain</a></br>A conversation between software engineer, cryptocurrency skeptic and cultural commentator Molly White and internet and society professor Jonathan Zittrain will take place today (January 12th) at 12:30pm EST. The conversation will cover the impact of cryptocurrencies on the world and what can be learned from them to build the next generation of the internet. The event is part of a discussion series to be led by White for H.L.S. Beyond in the spring.</p>

<p>Next, from <i>libereurope.eu</i>: <a href="https://libereurope.eu/article/the-fundamental-right-to-education-and-science-constitutional-law-v-copyright-law/" target="_blank">The Fundamental Right to Education and Science: Constitutional Law vs Copyright Law</a></br>The Finnish Parliament's Constitutional Law Committee has rejected the government's draft implementation of the Copyright in the Digital Single Market Directive, citing its conflict with human rights and in particular, the right to education and science. This is of particular significance given that the right to science extends to all forms of scientific activity, both commercial and non-commercial, and highlights the European legislators' tendency to equate innovation solely with the private sector. The rejection of the draft transposition also references the fundamental right of freedom of the arts and sciences and the right to education.</p>

<p>Finally, from <i>www.lawdork.com</i>: <a href="https://www.lawdork.com/p/exclusive-new-reports-aim-to-help" target="_blank">New reports aim to help lawmakers, advocates with advancing voter-friendly policies</a></br>The Institute for Responsive Government has released their Election Policy Progress Reports, a 50-state, plus DC, review of elections policies from the 2021 and 2022 legislative sessions. The report looks at changes in voting laws and how they affect voter security, efficiency, and accessibility. It also provides recommendations to lawmakers and advocates on advancing voter-friendly policies. The reports are meant to provide insight on legislative progress and to recognize states that have done well, like Kentucky and South Carolina, and those that have backslid, like Texas and Iowa.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's paper of the day is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4284105" target="_blank">When Teachers Misgender: The Free Speech Claims of Public School Teachers</a> by Caroline Mala Corbin. The paper argues that public school teachers do not have a free speech right to deliberately misgender students in the classroom, as it would be considered government speech. The paper also states that misgendering speech fails the requirements for a government employee speech claim, as it is not a discussion of an issue of public concern and is highly disruptive to the school's mission of educating students.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's January 11th, 2023.</p>

<p>This is Max with your news update. In tech news, researchers discover a vulnerability in California's new digital license plates. In politics, House Republicans have voted to cut billions of dollars from the IRS. Finally, Signs, the preeminent journal in women's, gender and sexuality studies, is celebrating its fiftieth anniversary, and seeking essays that address substantive feminist questions. Stay tuned. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <a href="https://jalopnik.com/researchers-hacked-californias-digital-license-plates-1849966295" target="_blank">jalopnik.com</a>: Researchers have discovered a vulnerability in California's new digital license plates, sold and managed by tech company Reviver. The vulnerability allowed the researchers to gain full access to users' GPS location, records, and the ability to change text displayed on digital plate displays. Fortunately, the vulnerability was quickly patched by Reviver after it was reported, and the company confirmed that no user data was leaked.</p>

<p>Next, from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/09/us/politics/house-republicans-irs-funding.html" target="_blank">www.nytimes.com</a>: House Republicans have voted to pass legislation to cut billions of dollars in funding from the Internal Revenue Service (I.R.S.). The measure, which was supported by all Republicans in the House, does not have enough votes to pass the Democratic-controlled Senate, nor will it receive approval from President Biden, who has already stated he will veto it. The money was originally intended to help the I.R.S. crack down on tax cheats, hire 87,000 I.R.S. employees and modernize its technology systems. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the legislation would actually increase the federal deficit by $114 billion. Democrats argue that the bill is a giveaway to the wealthy and corporations, while Republicans say that the I.R.S. needs a reckoning.</p>

<p>Finally, from <a href="http://signsjournal.org/for-authors/calls-for-papers/" target="_blank">signsjournal.org</a>: Signs, a preeminent journal in women’s, gender, and sexuality studies, is celebrating its fiftieth anniversary this year. In honor of this milestone, the journal is seeking to generate new questions and critical discussion about “Big Feminism” – about the role and power of feminist theory – today and into the future. From the standpoint of 1975, 2025 may appear to be a feminist pipe dream, but there have been consequential feminist debates and the emergence of new analytical and theoretical frames. Signs is encouraging transdisciplinary and transnational essays that address substantive feminist questions, debates, and controversies and is seeking essays that are passionate, strongly argued, and willing to take risks. The deadline for submissions is February 1, 2023.</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4319470" target="_blank">paper of the day</a> is entitled "The Plural Sources of Customary International Law" written by Harlan Grant Cohen. The paper aims to explore the different "theories of custom" that can be used to interpret customary international law. It uncovers three distinct concepts of custom commonly used, known as Negotiated Law, Legislated Law, and Adjudicated Law. Each of these concepts has its own sources of legitimacy and methods of interpretation, and this makes it difficult for courts to decide which custom to interpret and how.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's January 10th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's edition! Today we'll be discussing the dangers of US armed conflict without proper Congressional oversight, the consequences of relying too heavily on English in cognitive science, and Microsoft's plans to use OpenAI's chatbot technology in Word, PowerPoint, Outlook and other apps. Stay tuned for more on these stories! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/secret-war-unauthorized-combat-and-legal-loopholes-tickets-479969330187?aff=EventsNewsletter0104" target="_blank">www.eventbrite.com</a>: This online event, taking place on January 18th at 3:00 PM EST, is hosted by the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law. It will address the dangers of the US engaging in armed conflict without appropriate Congressional oversight. Through lesser-known laws, a handful of government officials have been able to act without notifying key decision-makers or the public. The panel will be moderated by Elias Yousif from the Stimson Center and will feature Katherine Yon Ebright, Oona Hathaway, and Wesley Morgan. This event offers one New York State CLE credit.</p>

<p>Next, from <a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(22)00236-4" target="_blank">www.cell.com</a>: This article describes the consequences of an over-reliance on English in the cognitive sciences. It argues that this has led to an underestimation of the role of language in cognitive processes and biases in research programs. The authors suggest that cognitive science should incorporate more linguistic diversity in its research in order to better understand the representational and computational capacities of the human mind.</p>

<p>Finally, from <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/ghost-writer-microsoft-looks-to-add-openais-chatbot-technology-to-word-email" target="_blank">www.theinformation.com</a>: Microsoft is looking to use OpenAI's chatbot technology in Word, PowerPoint, Outlook and other apps to allow customers to generate text from prompts. Microsoft engineers and researchers have been working to create personalized AI tools for composing emails and documents that remain secure. The AI-powered tools could be a game changer for more than a billion people who use Microsoft's apps, but could also be a turn-off if mistakes are made.</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4246818" target="_blank">paper of the day</a> is titled "Sri Lanka Personal Data Protection Legislation – An Overview" by Jayantha Fernando and Sanduni Wickramasinghe. This paper discusses the Personal Data Protection Act No.9 of 2022, which is the first of its kind comprehensive data protection legislation in South Asia. It examines the salient features of the legislation and its potential impact on the socio-economic conditions of Sri Lanka.</p>

<p>It's January 9th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's news update! In the House of Representatives, Kevin McCarthy struggled to gain the votes he needs to become Speaker. Meanwhile, artist Jan van Schaik is creating sculptures with LEGO bricks to explore questions of legacy and decay. Finally, the firing of an art history lecturer at Hamline University has caused controversy and debate over academic freedom and free speech. Stay tuned for more! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <a href="https://terikanefield.com/an-insurrection-by-any-other-name/" target="_blank">terikanefield.com</a>: This week in the House of Representatives, Kevin McCarthy had difficulty securing enough votes to become Speaker of the House due to a small group of Republicans who sympathized with the insurrection and helped spread Trump’s election lies. This group demanded control over House rules and other vital committees and the ability to call for a vote ousting the speaker. This is an example of what we can expect in the future, with the GOP in control of the House and the group's libertarian free-for-all ideology driving their decision making.</p>

<p>Next, from <a href="https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2023/01/lost-tablets-jan-van-schaik/" target="_blank">www.thisiscolossal.com</a>: This article introduces Jan van Schaik, an architect and artist based in Melbourne, Australia. Van Schaik is working on an ongoing art project called "Lost Tablets" which consists of 89 sculptures, each standing about ten inches tall and made entirely from secondhand LEGO bricks. Van Schaik's sculptures are inspired by monuments and buildings from around the world and are meant to explore questions of legacy and decay. The artist plans to complete the series this year, followed by the publication of a book.</p>

<p>Finally, from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/08/us/hamline-university-islam-prophet-muhammad.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare" target="_blank">www.nytimes.com</a>: This news article reports on the controversy that erupted at Hamline University in St. Paul, Minnesota, when an art history lecturer displayed a painting of the Prophet Muhammad to her students. Muslim students in the course and outside of it raised an outcry, and the university responded by firing the lecturer. However, many scholars and free speech advocates argued that the decision violated academic freedom and free speech principles. The article discusses the impact of the decision on the lecturer, the university and the student body.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3954552" target="_blank">paper of the day</a> is The Three Faces of Control written by Ann Lipton. The paper explores the unique legal treatment of controlling shareholders under Delaware law. It argues that Delaware doctrine subjects controlling shareholders to three distinct legal obligations: (1) fiduciary duties to the corporation; (2) a unique cleansing regime in order to win business judgment deference from reviewing courts; and (3) different treatment when certain transactions involving sales of control are challenged in court. The paper suggests that a contextual approach to the meaning of control should be adopted in order to develop a more rational and consistent set of definitions.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's January 8th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to the news roundup! Today we have a story about Rep. Jim Jordan's proposal to create a select subcommittee to review criminal investigations; a discussion about the legitimacy of the Supreme Court and the role of lawyers in our society; and the tale of how the writer of the poem at the end of Minecraft is dedicating it to the public domain. Stay tuned for more! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/07/gop-panel-criminal-investigations-00076890" target="_blank">www.politico.com</a>: Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) is proposing a "select subcommittee" to review ongoing criminal investigations and have access to information shared with the House Intelligence Committee. The subcommittee would be authorized by Jordan and be able to investigate how executive branch agencies interact with citizens and other government agencies. This proposal follows the Justice Department's arrest and prosecution of hundreds of rioters and two ongoing criminal investigations connected to former President Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Next, from <a href="https://legaltalknetwork.com/podcasts/sidebar/2023/01/lady-justice-with-dahlia-lithwick-part-2/" target="_blank">legaltalknetwork.com</a>: This episode of SideBar, hosted by law school deans Jackie Gardina and Mitch Winick, features Dahlia Lithwick, a senior legal correspondent at Slate and host of the podcast Amicus. Part II of the wide-ranging conversation covers the legitimacy of the Supreme Court and the critical role lawyers play in our society. Dahlia talks about her book, Lady Justice: Women, the Law, and the Battle to Save America. Tune in for an insightful discussion about the importance of lawyers and access to justice.</p>

<p>Finally, from <a href="https://theeggandtherock.substack.com/p/i-wrote-a-story-for-a-friend" target="_blank">theeggandtherock.substack.com</a>: This post is about the author writing the ending to the popular video game, Minecraft, which Microsoft bought from Mojang and does not own the rights to. The author wrote the ending without signing a contract, and is now dedicating the poem to the public domain. The author recounts how he wrote the ending for a friend, but that things didn't turn out as expected. They did not understand each other, leading Microsoft to commit the largest copyright offence in history. The author is now dedicating the poem to the public domain, so anyone can play with it.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3922907" target="_blank">paper of the day</a> is titled "Due Dates in the Real World: Extensions, Equity, and the Hidden Curriculum" authored by Sarah Schendel from Suffolk University Law School. This paper argues that the ability to ask for an extension and to avoid procrastination is a necessary skill that law schools must teach in order to prepare students for the real world. It looks at educational pedagogy, the Model Rules of Professional Conduct, cases of attorney discipline, and legal ethics to make the case for extensions in law school and in the real world.</p>

<p>Today, we're discussing the implications of digitizing cultural heritage, the Florida law that is attempting to limit the teaching of critical race theory in higher education, and a Connecticut judge suspending the law license of attorney Norm Pattis after his Alex Jones discovery mishap. Stay tuned to learn more about these stories and the potential impacts! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <a href="http://copyrightblog.kluweriplaw.com/2023/01/05/who-holds-copyright-in-3d-copies-of-repatriated-cultural-heritage/" target="_blank">copyrightblog.kluweriplaw.com</a>: This article discusses the implications of digitizing cultural heritage, including who holds the copyright of the digital copies and what happens to them when the artefacts are repatriated. The article suggests that 3D scanning may create new challenges, as the copyright of the digital copies will be determined by copyright laws, and whoever holds the copyright may have control over how the heritage is viewed and shared by the public.</p>

<p>Next, from <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/ron-desantis-florida-critical-race-theory-professors/672507/?utm_source=copy-link&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=share" target="_blank">www.theatlantic.com</a>: A federal judge has blocked the enforcement of a law signed by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis which would limit the teaching of critical race theory in higher education. However, the law has already had effects on professors who felt the need to cancel their courses discussing the subject matter out of fear of potential repercussions. The DeSantis administration has filed an appeal and is hoping to stay the injunction pending the appeal.</p>

<p>Finally, from <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/06/politics/alex-jones-lawyer-suspended-sandy-hook/index.html" target="_blank">www.cnn.com</a>: A Connecticut judge has suspended the law license of attorney Norm Pattis, who is representing right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, after Pattis allegedly released confidential court documents from the Sandy Hook case. Judge Barbara Bellis rejected Pattis' assertion that the mistake was inadvertent, and said that Pattis displayed a lack of fairness and decency in handling the sensitive information. Despite the suspension, Pattis is still part of a legal team representing Proud Boys leader Joseph Biggs.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4251921" target="_blank">paper of the day</a> is "The Case Against Commercial Casebooks" written by W. David Ball and Michelle Oberman. It highlights the benefits of using open-source, online casebooks over for-profit commercial casebooks in the legal academy. It shows how open-source casebooks are surprisingly easy to create and how they enable professors to center their personal pedagogical goals and values. Moreover, this paper outlines practical strategies for easing the transition to open-source casebooks.</p>

<p>It's January 6th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to today's news! In South Carolina, abortion access has been protected as the state's Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional a law banning abortion after six weeks. Meanwhile, Idaho's Supreme Court allowed a state law totally banning abortion and forbidding it after six weeks to stay in effect. We'll also take a look at the rise in crime across the United States, and the Federal Trade Commission's proposed rule to prohibit employers from imposing noncompete clauses on workers. Stay tuned for details! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/south-carolinas-top-court-strikes-down-states-6-week-abortion-ban-2023-01-05/" target="_blank">www.reuters.com</a>: South Carolina's Supreme Court has ruled that a state law banning abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy was unconstitutional, while Idaho's Supreme Court found that the state constitution did not protect a right to abortion. The rulings come after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the Roe v. Wade decision in June, leaving the fate of abortion access to be determined by state law. In South Carolina, the gestational limit on abortion is now 22 weeks, while in Idaho, laws that totally ban abortion and forbid abortion after six weeks are allowed to remain in effect. The former decision is a major victory for abortion rights supporters in the U.S South.</p>

<p>Next, from <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/myths-and-realities-understanding-recent-trends-violent-crime?fbclid=IwAR1usTARDeuGU_5z_ns6Q3BJXk5l5vA684kHNUXpNopg600K2SjGUlqCGtA" target="_blank">www.brennancenter.org</a>: The recent rise in crime has been seen across the United States in 2020, with murder rates increasing by nearly 30%. Poor and disadvantaged communities have been disproportionately affected. However, despite politicized claims, the rise in murder rates was similar in cities run by Democrats and Republicans. Property crime has decreased, while gun assault and motor vehicle theft have increased. It is too soon to tell with certainty why crime has risen over the last two years, but researchers are beginning to identify contributing factors.</p>

<p>Finally, from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/01/05/ftc-noncompete-ban-lina-khan/?utm_campaign=wp_post_most&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&wpisrc=nl_most&carta-url=https%3A%2F%2Fs2.washingtonpost.com%2Fcar-ln-tr%2F38bc11f%2F63b70842ef9bf67b234bebad%2F5a3d5f28ade4e25c8fa4d234%2F36%2F72%2F63b70842ef9bf67b234bebad&wp_cu=5390e2dff16930e1d1c31f3dd14d7ffa%7C60F39CD2CA595B9DE0530100007FE2F3" target="_blank">www.washingtonpost.com</a>: The Federal Trade Commission has proposed a rule to prohibit employers from imposing noncompete clauses on workers. The ban would make it illegal for companies to enter into noncompete contracts with employees or continue to maintain such contracts if they already exist and would open up new job opportunities for 30 million Americans and raise wages by $300 billion a year. The proposed rule is based on an initial finding that noncompete clauses violate Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and has been met with outrage from some parts of the business community.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4298626" target="_blank">paper of the day</a> is titled "Diversity Washing" and is written by Andrew Baker, David F. Larcker, Charles McClure, Durgesh Saraph, and Edward M. Watts. The paper looks at whether U.S. publicly traded corporations opportunistically use voluntary disclosures about their commitments to employee diversity. It finds discrepancies between companies' disclosed commitments and their actual employee gender and racial diversity, and that firms that discuss diversity more than their actual employee diversity warrants are classified as “diversity washers." It also finds that diversity-washing firms obtain superior scores from environmental, social, and governance (ESG) rating organizations and attract investment from institutional investors with an ESG focus, despite their increased risk of discrimination violations.</p>

<p>It's January 5th, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome back, friends! Our big stories today cover a range of topics from the creative to the chaotic. First, we’re taking a look at a LEGO Ideas submission for the popular meme ‘This is Fine’. Then, we’re investigating the implications of artificial intelligence-powered chatbot technology in New York City classrooms. And finally, we’re diving into the potential chaos that could arise if the Supreme Court adopts the ‘independent state legislature theory’ in Moore v. Harper. So, stay tuned to find out more about these stories! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/a6a24359-d8d3-4276-97a0-3c998deb1206" target="_blank">ideas.lego.com</a>: A LEGO builder, legotruman, has created a model of the popular meme, 'This is Fine' (the one where the dog is sitting in a burning room drinking a coffee), as a full set and submitted it to LEGO Ideas. Voters can express their support and leave feedback for the creator based on three criteria - Originality, Building Techniques and Details. Voting takes just two minutes and is completely free.</p>

<p>Next, from <a href="https://ny.chalkbeat.org/2023/1/3/23537987/nyc-schools-ban-chatgpt-writing-artificial-intelligence" target="_blank">ny.chalkbeat.org</a>: New York City students and teachers can no longer access ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence-powered chatbot, on education department devices or internet networks. The technology has sparked fears among some schools and educators that their writing assignments could soon become obsolete. The education department has blocked access to the program due to concerns about negative impacts on student learning, and the potential for cheating and plagiarism. However, some educators have argued that the program could actually be beneficial in some cases. Meanwhile, other districts are still weighing how to respond to the arrival of the dynamic new technology. [Editor's note: the Large Language Model behind ChatGPT is the same one used to summarize the articles here.]</p>

<p>Finally, from <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/there-no-lite-version-independent-state-legislature-theory" target="_blank">www.brennancenter.org</a>: This article warns of the potential chaos that could arise if the Supreme Court adopts the so-called "independent state legislature theory" in Moore v. Harper. It states that this theory could eliminate the system of checks and balances that has been in place for over two centuries and upend state laws that protect the right to vote, such as those that guarantee absentee ballots, automatic voter registration, and equal protection of the law. The article suggests that these "compromise" positions put forward by the gerrymanderers would not limit the damage and ultimately lead to the most extreme result of the theory.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4032912" target="_blank">paper of the day</a> is "The Antibody Patent Paradox" by Mark A. Lemley and Jacob S. Sherkow. This paper discusses the increasing use of patents to protect antibodies and the accompanying implications for innovation. The authors argue that the Federal Circuit has recently increased requirements for patentees to disclose or teach how to make and use the “full scope” of their inventions, which has had an unexpected effect on the patentability of antibodies. They suggest a middle ground approach of using means-plus-function claims and infringement by the equivalents to limit patentees to claiming only the specific structural features of antibodies they both possessed and described, but also entitled them to assert their patents against antibodies with equivalent functions but different structural characteristics.</p>

          <![CDATA[<p>TRANSCRIPT WITH LINKS:</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's January 4th, 2023.</p>

<p>This is Max with a rundown of today's top stories. First, ransomware attacks on healthcare providers are on the rise. Researchers have found that these attacks have doubled since 2016 and have exposed the protected health information of over two hundred thousand patients. Next, California's high-speed rail project has been delayed for a long time, and now Governor Newsom is campaigning to release funds to jump-start the project. Finally, the UK government is looking into new anti-strike legislation that could affect public sector workers. Stay tuned for more on these stories as they develop. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/new-data-quantifies-ransomware-attacks-healthcare-providers" target="_blank">www.lawfareblog.com</a>: This article discusses the growing threat of ransomware attacks on healthcare providers in the U.S. Data collected by researchers shows that the number of ransomware attacks has more than doubled since 2016 and the average attack in 2021 exposed the protected health information of 229,000 patients. The article also explains the shortcomings of the current reporting requirements and offers suggestions for improving data collection.</p>

<p>Next, from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/29/california-high-speed-rail-bullet-train" target="_blank">www.theguardian.com</a>: California's high-speed rail project, originally planned to connect Los Angeles and San Francisco, has been delayed for 14 years and is facing a budget increase. Governor Gavin Newsom is now focusing on a 172-mile segment connecting medium-sized cities in the Central Valley, but that won't be finished until 2030 at the earliest. Optimists hope the stretch will prove to be a proof of concept, but there are many who believe the project is a boondoggle and a waste of money. Newsom is now campaigning for the release of the remaining $4.2bn in the 2008 bond fund to jump-start the project.</p>

<p>Finally, from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/02/unions-expected-to-take-legal-action-against-rishi-sunaks-anti-strike-laws" target="_blank">www.theguardian.com</a>: The government is exploring new anti-strike legislation that would require at least 20% of rail services to run during strikes. This legislation could be extended to include public sector workers such as NHS staff, teachers, fire services, and border force. Unions are expected to take legal action against the laws, as they believe it will not solve the problem of low pay. The legislation may be introduced soon after the return of Parliament, though it is likely to be challenged in court by unions.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4300663" target="_blank">paper of the day</a> is "On Bob Dylan" by Cass R. Sunstein. The paper explores Bob Dylan's refusal to identify with social movements of the 1960s, and it delves into the themes of his songs such as "Desolation Row" and "The Philosophy of Modern Song". It also analyzes Dylan's distaste for whatever is rote or routine and his appreciation for the dishabituating power of music and art.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's January 3rd, 2023.</p>

<p>Hey, everyone! It's Max here with your news roundup for the day. In Atlanta, Rico Marley was arrested for possessing an AR-15-style rifle in a Publix supermarket restroom. His lawyer argued that he did nothing illegal, but the case raises questions about how to handle such situations in states with permissive gun laws. Meanwhile, the new Republican-led Congress must decide how much power to decentralize or concentrate in the hands of a few. And finally, U.S. News & World Report is revamping its law school ranking system. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/02/us/atlanta-gun-laws.html" target="_blank">www.nytimes.com</a>: Rico Marley was arrested after he was spotted with an AR-15-style rifle propped against a wall in a Publix supermarket bathroom in Atlanta. His lawyer argued that he had done nothing illegal, as Georgia's gun laws are very permissive, but he was charged with 11 felonies before his charges were reduced later to 10 misdemeanors of reckless conduct. Experts say that this case and others like it raise the question of how to handle such situations in states with permissive gun laws, where police and prosecutors have limited tools at their disposal.</p>

<p>Next, from <a href="https://firstbranchforecast.com/2023/01/02/first-branch-forecast-for-january-2023-hindsight-is-2022/" target="_blank">firstbranchforecast.com</a>: The 117th Congress was surprisingly productive and had to contend with an attempted coup and a pandemic. The incoming Republican majority must decide whether to decentralize power or keep it concentrated in the hands of a few individuals. The Omnibus Appropriations bill provided increases in defense and non-defense spending, and included the Electoral Count Act. Anti-monopoly legislation also made it into law, despite corporate pro-monopoly advocates outspending opponents.</p>

<p>Finally, from <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-news-world-report-to-revamp-parts-of-its-law-school-ranking-11672667620" target="_blank">www.wsj.com</a>: U.S. News & World Report announced plans to revamp its law-school ranking in the wake of a public rebuke by top-ranked schools. The new ranking will give less weight to reputational surveys and will not take into account per-student expenditures, and will count graduates with school-funded public-interest legal fellowships the same as other employed graduates.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4314123" target="_blank">paper of the day</a> is "African Data Protection Laws: Politics, But as Usual" by Mailyn Fidler. This paper discusses how African countries have taken different approaches to cybersecurity and data protection regulations, using each category of regulation for a different political purpose. Fidler argues that African states have used cybersecurity regulation to resist outside, primarily European, influence, while they are generally supporting the adoption of European approaches when it comes to data protection regulations. Technology laws are doing political work, just not always the same political work.</p>

<p>It's January 2nd, 2023.</p>

<p>Welcome to the new world of 2023! It's a brand-new year for copyright law, with a slew of popular books, films, and stories entering the public domain. It's also a wild year for cryptocurrencies, with major collapses, bridge hacks, NFT thefts, and the deflation of the NFT bubble. And finally, the Suffolk University Law School's LIT Lab is hosting a one-day hybrid conference to discuss Collaboration at Scale from legal and law adjacent communities. Stay tuned for more tech and legal news coming your way! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <a href="https://copyrightlately.com/public-domain-day-2023/" target="_blank">copyrightlately.com</a>: On January 1, 2023, a slew of popular books, films, and stories first copyrighted in 1927, including The Hardy Boys, Steppenwolf, and The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes, entered the public domain in the United States. This event was delayed by the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, which extended the term of copyright protection for works from 75 to 95 years from publication.</p>

<p>Next, from <a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/p/in-2022-web3-went-just-great" target="_blank">newsletter.mollywhite.net</a>: In 2022, the cryptocurrency world saw a series of major collapses, bridge hacks, NFT thefts, and the deflation of the NFT bubble. Major collapses included those of Terra/Luna, Three Arrows Capital, Voyager, Celsius, and FTX. Bridge hacks saw a total of $1.7 billion stolen, with the most devastating being the Axie Infinity bridge hack, which saw $625 million taken by the North Korean Lazarus cybercrime group. Meanwhile, sixteen Bored Apes were stolen from collector Todd Kramer, with an estimated 143 apes having been stolen in total. Lastly, the NFT market saw an overall decrease in interest, with collector's NFTs becoming so valueless that they could not be offloaded for even pennies.</p>

<p>Finally, from <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfO8GLq01JdjikzdgE3FMUK0VlFQeePlM56I0oGpKxlsgp0yg/viewform" target="_blank">docs.google.com</a>: The Suffolk University Law School's LIT Lab is hosting a one-day hybrid conference on April 3rd, 2023 to discuss Collaboration at Scale from legal and law adjacent communities. Potential panelists and attendees can submit ideas for topics or case studies to be included in the program. Those who sign up can also receive updates about the program as it develops.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4313817" target="_blank">paper of the day</a> is titled "Rethinking Patent Law's Exclusive Appellate Jurisdiction" written by Christa Laser from the Cleveland-Marshall College of Law. This paper proposes retaining the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to continue to hear administrative appeals in patent, trade, or other cases deemed appropriate. It suggests returning jurisdiction over all district court patent appeals to the regional circuit courts and possibly creating a National Court of Appeals between the circuit courts and Supreme Court to decide cases of all types with a need for nationwide uniformity.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's January 1st, 2023.</p>

<p>Good morning, tech and news fans! I'm your host, Max, and I'm here to give you a preview of the stories making headlines today. First up is the story of Rep.-elect George Santos (R-N.Y.), who was exposed by a local newspaper for fabricating his résumé and biography. This story should remind us all of the importance of local media and its ability to uncover the truth. Next, we have the story of Kaitlyn Joshua, a woman from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, who experienced a difficult journey while seeking medical care for her pregnancy. Finally, this year has seen some groundbreaking advancements in tech and innovation, with decentralized social media networks leading the charge. Be sure to stay tuned for more updates on these stories, and more. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2022/12/29/north-shore-leader-santos-scoop/" target="_blank">www.washingtonpost.com</a>: A weekly publication on Long Island, the North Shore Leader, uncovered the story of Rep.-elect George Santos (R-N.Y.) fabricating his résumé and biography, months before any other news outlet reported it. Despite a well-heeled and well-connected readership, the story didn't get any national attention until after the election. Santos has since apologized for misrepresenting his background and has vowed to serve out his term as a member of Congress. Local news outlets have been suffering for years, with two disappearing each week, but this case has shown just how important it is to support local media.</p>

<p>Next, from <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/12/29/1143823727/bleeding-and-in-pain-she-couldnt-get-2-louisiana-ers-to-answer-is-it-a-miscarria" target="_blank">www.npr.org</a>: Kaitlyn Joshua, a 30-year-old woman from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, has had a difficult experience seeking medical care while pregnant. After being told that one physicians' group won't see her until she's 12 weeks pregnant, she experienced cramping and bleeding at 10 weeks and visits two emergency rooms. Both failed to provide her with answers or confirm that she was miscarrying, instead offering prayers. She eventually miscarried, leaving her and her husband traumatized and reconsidering their plans to have more children.</p>

<p>Finally, from <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/12/30/new-years-message-the-opportunity-to-build-a-better-internet-is-here-right-now/" target="_blank">www.techdirt.com</a>: This year has seen some groundbreaking advancements in technology and innovation, with decentralized social media networks like Mastodon leading the charge. OpenAI has made some significant progress in AI, with their DALL-E 2 and ChatGPT projects, while the Framework laptop is providing users with more control over the devices they own. It's also been an interesting year for cryptocurrency, with the collapse of FTX highlighting the prevalence of frauds and scams in the space. All of this points to a promising future for tech and innovation in the coming year.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4314839" target="_blank">paper of the day</a> is titled "GPT Takes the Bar Exam" written by Michael James Bommarito and Daniel Martin Katz. This research documents the experimental evaluation of OpenAI’s text-davinci-003 model, often-referred to as GPT-3.5, on the multistate multiple choice (MBE) section of the Bar Exam. After hyperparameter optimization and prompt engineering, GPT-3.5 achieved a headline correct rate of 50.3% with its top two and top three choices being correct 71% and 88% of the time, respectively. These results suggest that an LLM could pass the MBE component of the Bar Exam in the near future.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's December 31st, 2022.</p>

<p>Today we dive into the fascinating world of AI and its implications for the law. Tune in to the new podcast Esquiring Minds to hear legal minds discuss ChatGPT, Robot Vanna White, and the legal implications of Donald Trump's tax records. Then, we'll examine the debate on Signal App's privacy features and the importance of privacy as a fundamental right. Finally, we'll explore Rep. Don Beyer's mission to use AI to help with suicide prevention. All this and more coming up. Don't miss it! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <a href="https://zencastr.com/z/G6yPEGun" target="_blank">zencastr.com</a>: In the first episode of Esquiring Minds, the titular minds discuss the use of AI in the law, ChatGPT, and a story of an attorney being banned from Radio City Music Hall. They also touch on Madison Square Garden's use of facial recognition to ban its owner's enemies, Robot Vanna White, Steam Deck and an article discussing the legal implications of releasing Donald Trump's tax records.</p>

<p>Next, from <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2022/12/29/Privacy-is-OK" target="_blank">www.tbray.org</a>: This article addresses the concerns brought up by Reid Blackman's opinion piece in the New York Times about Signal App's privacy features. The author argues that privacy is a fundamental right, and the threat of eavesdropping on encrypted communication is not as great as it appears. Blackman argues that law enforcement should have access to Signal conversations, but the author points out that there is no practical way to give law enforcement access to Signal without breaking privacy for everyone. Finally, the author recommends Signal as a secure messaging app.</p>

<p>Finally, from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/12/28/beyer-student-artificial-intelligence-degree/" target="_blank">www.washingtonpost.com</a>: Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) is pursuing a master's degree in machine learning at George Mason University with hopes of one day applying his AI knowledge to his legislative work. With three classes done and four to go, he expects to begin the actual graduate work by 2024. His goal is to use his AI background to focus on suicide prevention, using AI to create risk profiles that could help clinicians identify which patients may be at higher risk and may need more services. He hopes to use AI to provide warning signs that clinicians may not immediately see.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4271894" target="_blank">paper of the day</a> is "Introduction to Intellectual Property Law" written by Lisa Larrimore Ouellette and Jonathan S. Masur. This one-day teaching module provides an introduction to U.S. intellectual property law, including trade secrets, utility patents, design patents, copyrights, and trademarks. It is designed for either the first day of a longer IP course or as a stand-alone module in a separate law, business, or policy class.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's December 30th, 2022.</p>

<p>Welcome to the world of social media, where Mastodon and other ActivityPub-based platforms are taking over. But before you join, be sure to check out the guidelines for using Mastodon's trademarks, as well as the tips and tricks for getting the most out of your Mastodon experience. And don't forget to support public libraries, which offer access to knowledge and inquiry to all, regardless of their wealth or status. Join us as we explore the world of social media and the importance of public libraries. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/trademark" target="_blank">joinmastodon.org</a>: This article outlines the guidelines for the use of Mastodon's trademarks such as their logos and name. Users must request permission from Mastodon gGmbH to use their marks in any way other than "fair" or "nominative" use and must agree to abide by the terms and conditions outlined in the article. The article also outlines guidelines for server operators, open source projects, and social media accounts.</p>

<p>Next, from <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/12/29/some-tricks-to-making-mastodon-way-more-useful/" target="_blank">www.techdirt.com</a>: Today, many people are migrating from Twitter to Mastodon and other ActivityPub-based social media platforms. To help people get the most out of their Mastodon experience, Mike Masnick shared some tips and tricks, such as using tools like Fedifinder, Debirdify, and Movetodon to find people to follow, and enabling the advanced web interface to get a multi-column view similar to Tweetdeck. He also suggests creating lists to help focus in on more interesting content and suggests the Mastodon List Manager app to make creating lists easier.</p>

<p>Finally, from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/28/usa-public-libraries" target="_blank">www.theguardian.com</a>: The public library is a sanctuary for anyone in America and a testament to what our country could one day be. It is a rare place of beauty and dignity, offering access to knowledge and inquiry to all, regardless of their wealth or status, paid for by public funding. However, library budgets are constantly under threat and Mayor Eric Adams has proposed drastic cuts to the New York Public Library system. We need to continue to invest in public libraries, to ensure that all citizens have access to the culture, learning, and knowledge that the public library offers.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3945976" target="_blank">paper of the day</a> is titled "Pandemic 'Disability Cons'" and is authored by Doron Dorfman of Seton Hall Law School. The paper discusses how the increased awareness of disability rights has resulted in a moral panic of people exploiting the law for an unfair advantage. Through the use of examples such as mask exemptions, vaccination priority, and permission to continue remote work, the paper examines how the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the schism between real versus perceived privileges granted to those with disabilities. It ultimately provides insight into the nature and scope of the fear of the disability con in order to inform more effective disability law practices in the future.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's December 29th, 2022.</p>

<p>Today, we're exploring the latest developments in the world of law, travel, and science. ProPublica is reporting on a new and unproven method of criminal conviction, while the Elias Law Group is leading the Democratic Party's legal strategy against Republican election denialism. And finally, the travel industry is launching a pan-European sleeper train service that promises to revolutionize the way we travel. Stay tuned for more on these stories! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/911-call-analysis-fbi-police-courts" target="_blank">www.propublica.org</a>: ProPublica is reporting that police and prosecutors across the country are using a new and unproven scientific method to determine guilt in criminal cases. The method, known as 911 call analysis, is based on the concept that a caller's tone of voice, pauses, word choice, and grammar can be used to determine guilt. Experts are warning that the method is inaccurate and should not be used for criminal convictions. However, some prosecutors have been using the method to win convictions in court. One man was wrongfully convicted and spent three and a half years in prison due to this method of analysis.</p>

<p>Next, from <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/12/21/democrats-elias-elections-00073595" target="_blank">www.politico.com</a>: Uzoma Nkwonta is a partner at the Elias Law Group, a firm that has become the central node of the official Democratic Party's legal strategy. After Donald Trump attempted to use the courts to change the results of the 2020 election, many Republicans have followed suit and Democrats are attempting to mount a counteroffensive. Nkwonta and his team have been tasked with protecting democratic candidates and the voting process amid a surge of election-related lawsuits. The Elias Law Group has become a powerful tool in the fight against Republican election denialism and their mission is to make sure that the Republican Party is held accountable.</p>

<p>Finally, from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/28/pan-european-sleeper-train-to-sweep-britons-to-berlin-from-may-2023" target="_blank">www.theguardian.com</a>: The travel industry is responding to rising fuel costs and climate damage with the launch of a pan-European sleeper train service in May. The European Sleeper service will offer passengers a chance to jump on a Eurostar at St Pancras and wake up in Berlin the following morning. The train will depart on 25 May and run three times each week. Prices range from €49 for a seat to €109 for a berth in a sleeper compartment. Rail aficionados have hailed the service as a triumph, and it follows a resurgence of sleeper trains across the continent.</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2714081" target="_blank">paper of the day</a> is called "The Patented Design" and it is written by Sarah Burstein of Suffolk University Law School. The paper looks at the law of design patents and the nature of the protected subject matter. It argues that a claimed shape on a different type of product or a visual representation of a patentee’s commercial embodiment should not be deemed to be infringing because the patented design should be conceptualized as the design as applied to a specific type of product, not as something akin to a copyrighted “work.” This analysis has implications for the larger policy debate over how designs should be protected as intellectual property.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's December 28th, 2022.</p>

<p>Welcome to the ultimate source for all the latest buzz! First up, a Russian sausage tycoon has died under mysterious circumstances in India. Then, a man in Arizona is suing for the wrongful death of an embryo. Finally, a law professor has put together a collection of fashion-related design patents. Stay tuned! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-64101437" target="_blank">www.bbc.com</a>: Pavel Antov, a millionaire Russian sausage tycoon and well-known politician in the city of Vladimir, has died in a fall from a hotel window in India. His death comes in the midst of a series of unexplained deaths of Russian tycoons since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Reports suggest that he was in India with three other Russians and that his friend, Vladimir Budanov, died of a stroke at the same hotel two days before. Antov had denied criticising the war in Ukraine after a message appeared on his WhatsApp account last summer.</p>

<p>Next, from <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/arizona-abortion-father-lawsuit-wrongful-death" target="_blank">www.propublica.org</a>: This article discusses how a man in Arizona is suing a clinic and its doctors for a wrongful death lawsuit of an embryo that was aborted four years ago. Experts believe this rare tactic could become more common as anti-abortion groups attempt to limit reproductive rights by using "unprecedented strategies." The lawsuit could also be an attempt to intimidate providers and punish people who have had abortions. In a similar case in Alabama, a judge dismissed the wrongful death lawsuit of an aborted embryo, stating that the claims were precluded by State and Federal laws.</p>

<p>Finally, from <a href="https://designpatentlookbook.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">designpatentlookbook.tumblr.com</a>: Sarah Burstein, a law professor, has curated a collection of fashion-related design patents. The collection includes items such as handbags, shoes, slippers, Birkenstock, Jimmy Choo, wearable blankets, hoodies and snuggies, among others. It provides an insight into fashion law and the various designs and patents related to it.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4295311" target="_blank">paper of the day</a> is "Off the Rails: The Surprising Story of Smith v. Rapid Transit, Inc." written by D. Michael Risinger. The paper explores the reality of transportation in Winthrop, Massachusetts in 1941 and offers a surprising perspective on the legal dispute leading to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court's opinion in the case. The reader is presented with a discussion of evidence, burden of proof, civil and criminal procedure, legal history, probability, and statistical proof.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's December 27th, 2022.</p>

<p>Welcome. Today we’ll be discussing proposed reforms to the Insurrection Act of 1792, the growing celebration of Kwanzakkah, and the Title 42 immigration policy. The Insurrection Act is facing scrutiny after its use during the Capitol attack and the Brennan Center is proposing reforms to ensure oversight is present. Kwanzakkah is a combination of Hanukkah and Kwanzaa and is being celebrated together to combat racism and antisemitism. And finally, Title 42 allows immigration officers to deny entry at the border in the midst of a pandemic, but it is being challenged by the Biden administration. Stay tuned for more on these stories and more! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/how-fix-insurrection-act?fbclid=IwAR2Ca_f6yslMBDci2EWB331OJn7TxqnhTOfCZD8IybH1h1oBZztw-x9aSPM" target="_blank">www.brennancenter.org</a>: The Brennan Center has proposed reforms to the Insurrection Act of 1792, which gives the President broad powers to deploy the military to enforce the law domestically. The proposal, developed with experts and allied organizations, would narrowly define when the President can deploy the military and what they can do. It would also put in place mechanisms for congressional and judicial oversight. The reforms are necessary to prevent abuse of the law, as seen in the events leading up to the January 6th attack on the Capitol.</p>

<p>Next, from <a href="https://forward.com/news/529652/kwanzakkah-a-way-to-celebrate-dual-heritage-and-combat-hate/?utm_source=Iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=sundayedition_5814762" target="_blank">forward.com</a>: This article focuses on the growing celebration of Kwanzakkah, which is a combination of Hanukkah and Kwanzaa. This year, the holidays are falling close together on the calendar and this has sparked a movement of people to celebrate the holidays together in order to combat the darkness of racism and antisemitism. People are encouraged to light both a menorah and a kinara, and events are being held online and in person throughout the US. The article also focuses on the shared legacy between Black and Jewish communities and the importance of recognizing and celebrating this connection.</p>

<p>Finally, from <a href="https://stevevladeck.substack.com/p/7-title-42" target="_blank">stevevladeck.substack.com</a>: This article discusses the Title 42 immigration policy, which was put into place by the Trump administration early in the COVID pandemic and allows immigration officers to deny entry at the border in the midst of a pandemic to those suspected of potentially carrying communicable diseases. It has been criticized as a pretext for more harsh asylum policies and the Biden administration attempted to rescind the policy but was blocked by a district court ruling. Currently, an emergency application is pending before the Supreme Court, raising the intersection of immigration, COVID, and newfound state efforts to control federal policymaking.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4304442#" target="_blank">paper of the day</a> is "Myths and Reality of Patent Law at the Supreme Court" written by Mark A. Lemley of Stanford Law School and Paul R. Gugliuzza of Temple University - James E. Beasley School of Law. This paper explores the conventional wisdom of the Supreme Court's role in patent law and separates myth from reality. The authors present a quantitative and qualitative study of all patent-related Supreme Court cases since 1982 and identify specific types of patent-related cases in which the Solicitor General wins far less frequently. The findings of this paper advance our understanding of how specialization affects judicial decisionmaking and the development of the law.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It—Law, an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's December 26th, 2022.</p>

<p>Welcome, this is Max bringing you the latest news. On Christmas Eve, busloads of migrants were dropped off in front of Vice President Kamala Harris' residence in Washington, DC. Meanwhile, Lisl Auman, a 22-year-old woman currently serving life in prison without parole for a crime she did not commit, is awaiting a ruling from the Colorado Supreme Court this summer. Finally, the People's Liberation Army conducted "strike drills" in the sea and airspace around Taiwan in response to what it says was provocation from the island. Stay tuned to find out the fate of these stories and more! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/24/politics/migrants-dropped-off-vice-president-christmas-eve/index.html" target="_blank">www.cnn.com</a>: On Christmas Eve, several busloads of migrants were dropped off in front of Vice President Kamala Harris' residence in Washington, DC, in freezing weather. The migrants were from Ecuador, Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Peru, and Colombia and were given blankets and put on another bus that went to a local church. The White House put the blame for the arrivals on Texas Governor Greg Abbott, calling it a "cruel, dangerous, and shameful stunt".</p>

<p>Next, from <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2004/06/innocent-murderer-200406" target="_blank">www.vanityfair.com</a>: Lisl Auman is a 22-year-old woman currently serving life in prison without parole for a crime she did not commit. Hunter S. Thompson has been campaigning for her release for three years, and the Colorado Supreme Court is about to make its ruling on her appeal this summer. Thompson and Mark Seal expose the brutality, corruption, and arcane legal strategy that doomed Auman--who wrote to Thompson from prison--and threaten the rights of all Americans. Her family has set up a website to support her, and Thompson is trying to help her by bringing attention to her case and writing a story about it.</p>

<p>Finally, from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/china-stages-drills-citing-us-taiwan-provocation-2022-12-25/" target="_blank">www.reuters.com</a>: Reuters reported that China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) conducted "strike drills" in the sea and airspace around Taiwan on Sunday in response to what it said was provocation from the democratically-governed island and the United States. The drills showed Beijing's mentality of resolving differences by force, which Taiwan's defense ministry said was not conducive to China's international image. The United States is Taiwan's most important international backer and arms supplier, despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties. Taiwan has complained of repeated Chinese military activity nearby over the last three years or so as Beijing seeks to pressure Taipei to accept Chinese sovereignty.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4250452" target="_blank">paper of the day</a> is The Copyright Claims Board: Good News or Bad News for Communication Scholars?, written by Patricia Aufderheide and Aram Sinnreich. This paper explores the implications of the U.S. Copyright Claims Board (CCB), created in 2020, for communication scholars. The authors surveyed communication and Internet scholars to assess their willingness to take risks when challenged for fair use of copyrighted material. They found that the CCB may not serve its stated purpose due to scholars’ fear of legal entanglements, as well as their inability to protect their work in this venue. The paper concludes that the nascent CCB should be closely monitored by communication and Internet scholars.</p>
