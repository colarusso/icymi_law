<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's December 31st, 2022.</p>

<p>Today we dive into the fascinating world of AI and its implications for the law. Tune in to the new podcast Esquiring Minds to hear legal minds discuss ChatGPT, Robot Vanna White, and the legal implications of Donald Trump's tax records. Then, we'll examine the debate on Signal App's privacy features and the importance of privacy as a fundamental right. Finally, we'll explore Rep. Don Beyer's mission to use AI to help with suicide prevention. All this and more coming up. Don't miss it! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <a href="https://zencastr.com/z/G6yPEGun" target="_blank">zencastr.com</a>: In the first episode of Esquiring Minds, the titular minds discuss the use of AI in the law, ChatGPT, and a story of an attorney being banned from Radio City Music Hall. They also touch on Madison Square Garden's use of facial recognition to ban its owner's enemies, Robot Vanna White, Steam Deck and an article discussing the legal implications of releasing Donald Trump's tax records.</p>

<p>Next, from <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2022/12/29/Privacy-is-OK" target="_blank">www.tbray.org</a>: This article addresses the concerns brought up by Reid Blackman's opinion piece in the New York Times about Signal App's privacy features. The author argues that privacy is a fundamental right, and the threat of eavesdropping on encrypted communication is not as great as it appears. Blackman argues that law enforcement should have access to Signal conversations, but the author points out that there is no practical way to give law enforcement access to Signal without breaking privacy for everyone. Finally, the author recommends Signal as a secure messaging app.</p>

<p>Finally, from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/12/28/beyer-student-artificial-intelligence-degree/" target="_blank">www.washingtonpost.com</a>: Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) is pursuing a master's degree in machine learning at George Mason University with hopes of one day applying his AI knowledge to his legislative work. With three classes done and four to go, he expects to begin the actual graduate work by 2024. His goal is to use his AI background to focus on suicide prevention, using AI to create risk profiles that could help clinicians identify which patients may be at higher risk and may need more services. He hopes to use AI to provide warning signs that clinicians may not immediately see.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4271894" target="_blank">paper of the day</a> is "Introduction to Intellectual Property Law" written by Lisa Larrimore Ouellette and Jonathan S. Masur. This one-day teaching module provides an introduction to U.S. intellectual property law, including trade secrets, utility patents, design patents, copyrights, and trademarks. It is designed for either the first day of a longer IP course or as a stand-alone module in a separate law, business, or policy class.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's December 30th, 2022.</p>

<p>Welcome to the world of social media, where Mastodon and other ActivityPub-based platforms are taking over. But before you join, be sure to check out the guidelines for using Mastodon's trademarks, as well as the tips and tricks for getting the most out of your Mastodon experience. And don't forget to support public libraries, which offer access to knowledge and inquiry to all, regardless of their wealth or status. Join us as we explore the world of social media and the importance of public libraries. And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/trademark" target="_blank">joinmastodon.org</a>: This article outlines the guidelines for the use of Mastodon's trademarks such as their logos and name. Users must request permission from Mastodon gGmbH to use their marks in any way other than "fair" or "nominative" use and must agree to abide by the terms and conditions outlined in the article. The article also outlines guidelines for server operators, open source projects, and social media accounts.</p>

<p>Next, from <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/12/29/some-tricks-to-making-mastodon-way-more-useful/" target="_blank">www.techdirt.com</a>: Today, many people are migrating from Twitter to Mastodon and other ActivityPub-based social media platforms. To help people get the most out of their Mastodon experience, Mike Masnick shared some tips and tricks, such as using tools like Fedifinder, Debirdify, and Movetodon to find people to follow, and enabling the advanced web interface to get a multi-column view similar to Tweetdeck. He also suggests creating lists to help focus in on more interesting content and suggests the Mastodon List Manager app to make creating lists easier.</p>

<p>Finally, from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/28/usa-public-libraries" target="_blank">www.theguardian.com</a>: The public library is a sanctuary for anyone in America and a testament to what our country could one day be. It is a rare place of beauty and dignity, offering access to knowledge and inquiry to all, regardless of their wealth or status, paid for by public funding. However, library budgets are constantly under threat and Mayor Eric Adams has proposed drastic cuts to the New York Public Library system. We need to continue to invest in public libraries, to ensure that all citizens have access to the culture, learning, and knowledge that the public library offers.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3945976" target="_blank">paper of the day</a> is titled "Pandemic 'Disability Cons'" and is authored by Doron Dorfman of Seton Hall Law School. The paper discusses how the increased awareness of disability rights has resulted in a moral panic of people exploiting the law for an unfair advantage. Through the use of examples such as mask exemptions, vaccination priority, and permission to continue remote work, the paper examines how the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the schism between real versus perceived privileges granted to those with disabilities. It ultimately provides insight into the nature and scope of the fear of the disability con in order to inform more effective disability law practices in the future.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's December 29th, 2022.</p>

<p>Today, we're exploring the latest developments in the world of law, travel, and science. ProPublica is reporting on a new and unproven method of criminal conviction, while the Elias Law Group is leading the Democratic Party's legal strategy against Republican election denialism. And finally, the travel industry is launching a pan-European sleeper train service that promises to revolutionize the way we travel. Stay tuned for more on these stories! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/911-call-analysis-fbi-police-courts" target="_blank">www.propublica.org</a>: ProPublica is reporting that police and prosecutors across the country are using a new and unproven scientific method to determine guilt in criminal cases. The method, known as 911 call analysis, is based on the concept that a caller's tone of voice, pauses, word choice, and grammar can be used to determine guilt. Experts are warning that the method is inaccurate and should not be used for criminal convictions. However, some prosecutors have been using the method to win convictions in court. One man was wrongfully convicted and spent three and a half years in prison due to this method of analysis.</p>

<p>Next, from <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/12/21/democrats-elias-elections-00073595" target="_blank">www.politico.com</a>: Uzoma Nkwonta is a partner at the Elias Law Group, a firm that has become the central node of the official Democratic Party's legal strategy. After Donald Trump attempted to use the courts to change the results of the 2020 election, many Republicans have followed suit and Democrats are attempting to mount a counteroffensive. Nkwonta and his team have been tasked with protecting democratic candidates and the voting process amid a surge of election-related lawsuits. The Elias Law Group has become a powerful tool in the fight against Republican election denialism and their mission is to make sure that the Republican Party is held accountable.</p>

<p>Finally, from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/28/pan-european-sleeper-train-to-sweep-britons-to-berlin-from-may-2023" target="_blank">www.theguardian.com</a>: The travel industry is responding to rising fuel costs and climate damage with the launch of a pan-European sleeper train service in May. The European Sleeper service will offer passengers a chance to jump on a Eurostar at St Pancras and wake up in Berlin the following morning. The train will depart on 25 May and run three times each week. Prices range from €49 for a seat to €109 for a berth in a sleeper compartment. Rail aficionados have hailed the service as a triumph, and it follows a resurgence of sleeper trains across the continent.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2714081" target="_blank">paper of the day</a> is called "The Patented Design" and it is written by Sarah Burstein of Suffolk University Law School. The paper looks at the law of design patents and the nature of the protected subject matter. It argues that a claimed shape on a different type of product or a visual representation of a patentee’s commercial embodiment should not be deemed to be infringing because the patented design should be conceptualized as the design as applied to a specific type of product, not as something akin to a copyrighted “work.” This analysis has implications for the larger policy debate over how designs should be protected as intellectual property.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's December 28th, 2022.</p>

<p>Welcome to the ultimate source for all the latest buzz! First up, a Russian sausage tycoon has died under mysterious circumstances in India. Then, a man in Arizona is suing for the wrongful death of an embryo. Finally, a law professor has put together a collection of fashion-related design patents. Stay tuned! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-64101437" target="_blank">www.bbc.com</a>: Pavel Antov, a millionaire Russian sausage tycoon and well-known politician in the city of Vladimir, has died in a fall from a hotel window in India. His death comes in the midst of a series of unexplained deaths of Russian tycoons since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Reports suggest that he was in India with three other Russians and that his friend, Vladimir Budanov, died of a stroke at the same hotel two days before. Antov had denied criticising the war in Ukraine after a message appeared on his WhatsApp account last summer.</p>

<p>Next, from <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/arizona-abortion-father-lawsuit-wrongful-death" target="_blank">www.propublica.org</a>: This article discusses how a man in Arizona is suing a clinic and its doctors for a wrongful death lawsuit of an embryo that was aborted four years ago. Experts believe this rare tactic could become more common as anti-abortion groups attempt to limit reproductive rights by using "unprecedented strategies." The lawsuit could also be an attempt to intimidate providers and punish people who have had abortions. In a similar case in Alabama, a judge dismissed the wrongful death lawsuit of an aborted embryo, stating that the claims were precluded by State and Federal laws.</p>

<p>Finally, from <a href="https://designpatentlookbook.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">designpatentlookbook.tumblr.com</a>: Sarah Burstein, a law professor, has curated a collection of fashion-related design patents. The collection includes items such as handbags, shoes, slippers, Birkenstock, Jimmy Choo, wearable blankets, hoodies and snuggies, among others. It provides an insight into fashion law and the various designs and patents related to it.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4295311" target="_blank">paper of the day</a> is "Off the Rails: The Surprising Story of Smith v. Rapid Transit, Inc." written by D. Michael Risinger. The paper explores the reality of transportation in Winthrop, Massachusetts in 1941 and offers a surprising perspective on the legal dispute leading to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court's opinion in the case. The reader is presented with a discussion of evidence, burden of proof, civil and criminal procedure, legal history, probability, and statistical proof.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It (Law), an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's December 27th, 2022.</p>

<p>Welcome. Today we’ll be discussing proposed reforms to the Insurrection Act of 1792, the growing celebration of Kwanzakkah, and the Title 42 immigration policy. The Insurrection Act is facing scrutiny after its use during the Capitol attack and the Brennan Center is proposing reforms to ensure oversight is present. Kwanzakkah is a combination of Hanukkah and Kwanzaa and is being celebrated together to combat racism and antisemitism. And finally, Title 42 allows immigration officers to deny entry at the border in the midst of a pandemic, but it is being challenged by the Biden administration. Stay tuned for more on these stories and more! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/how-fix-insurrection-act?fbclid=IwAR2Ca_f6yslMBDci2EWB331OJn7TxqnhTOfCZD8IybH1h1oBZztw-x9aSPM" target="_blank">www.brennancenter.org</a>: The Brennan Center has proposed reforms to the Insurrection Act of 1792, which gives the President broad powers to deploy the military to enforce the law domestically. The proposal, developed with experts and allied organizations, would narrowly define when the President can deploy the military and what they can do. It would also put in place mechanisms for congressional and judicial oversight. The reforms are necessary to prevent abuse of the law, as seen in the events leading up to the January 6th attack on the Capitol.</p>

<p>Next, from <a href="https://forward.com/news/529652/kwanzakkah-a-way-to-celebrate-dual-heritage-and-combat-hate/?utm_source=Iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=sundayedition_5814762" target="_blank">forward.com</a>: This article focuses on the growing celebration of Kwanzakkah, which is a combination of Hanukkah and Kwanzaa. This year, the holidays are falling close together on the calendar and this has sparked a movement of people to celebrate the holidays together in order to combat the darkness of racism and antisemitism. People are encouraged to light both a menorah and a kinara, and events are being held online and in person throughout the US. The article also focuses on the shared legacy between Black and Jewish communities and the importance of recognizing and celebrating this connection.</p>

<p>Finally, from <a href="https://stevevladeck.substack.com/p/7-title-42" target="_blank">stevevladeck.substack.com</a>: This article discusses the Title 42 immigration policy, which was put into place by the Trump administration early in the COVID pandemic and allows immigration officers to deny entry at the border in the midst of a pandemic to those suspected of potentially carrying communicable diseases. It has been criticized as a pretext for more harsh asylum policies and the Biden administration attempted to rescind the policy but was blocked by a district court ruling. Currently, an emergency application is pending before the Supreme Court, raising the intersection of immigration, COVID, and newfound state efforts to control federal policymaking.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4304442#" target="_blank">paper of the day</a> is "Myths and Reality of Patent Law at the Supreme Court" written by Mark A. Lemley of Stanford Law School and Paul R. Gugliuzza of Temple University - James E. Beasley School of Law. This paper explores the conventional wisdom of the Supreme Court's role in patent law and separates myth from reality. The authors present a quantitative and qualitative study of all patent-related Supreme Court cases since 1982 and identify specific types of patent-related cases in which the Solicitor General wins far less frequently. The findings of this paper advance our understanding of how specialization affects judicial decisionmaking and the development of the law.</p>

<p>Welcome to In Case You Missed It—Law, an algorithmicly-generated examination of my Mastodon timeline. I'm Max, your host. I follow a bunch of lawyers, law profs, and the like so you don't have too.</p>

<p>It's December 26th, 2022.</p>

<p>Welcome, this is Max bringing you the latest news. On Christmas Eve, busloads of migrants were dropped off in front of Vice President Kamala Harris' residence in Washington, DC. Meanwhile, Lisl Auman, a 22-year-old woman currently serving life in prison without parole for a crime she did not commit, is awaiting a ruling from the Colorado Supreme Court this summer. Finally, the People's Liberation Army conducted "strike drills" in the sea and airspace around Taiwan in response to what it says was provocation from the island. Stay tuned to find out the fate of these stories and more! And after the news, stick around for our paper of the day! </p>

<p>First, from <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/24/politics/migrants-dropped-off-vice-president-christmas-eve/index.html" target="_blank">www.cnn.com</a>: On Christmas Eve, several busloads of migrants were dropped off in front of Vice President Kamala Harris' residence in Washington, DC, in freezing weather. The migrants were from Ecuador, Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Peru, and Colombia and were given blankets and put on another bus that went to a local church. The White House put the blame for the arrivals on Texas Governor Greg Abbott, calling it a "cruel, dangerous, and shameful stunt".</p>

<p>Next, from <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2004/06/innocent-murderer-200406" target="_blank">www.vanityfair.com</a>: Lisl Auman is a 22-year-old woman currently serving life in prison without parole for a crime she did not commit. Hunter S. Thompson has been campaigning for her release for three years, and the Colorado Supreme Court is about to make its ruling on her appeal this summer. Thompson and Mark Seal expose the brutality, corruption, and arcane legal strategy that doomed Auman--who wrote to Thompson from prison--and threaten the rights of all Americans. Her family has set up a website to support her, and Thompson is trying to help her by bringing attention to her case and writing a story about it.</p>

<p>Finally, from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/china-stages-drills-citing-us-taiwan-provocation-2022-12-25/" target="_blank">www.reuters.com</a>: Reuters reported that China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) conducted "strike drills" in the sea and airspace around Taiwan on Sunday in response to what it said was provocation from the democratically-governed island and the United States. The drills showed Beijing's mentality of resolving differences by force, which Taiwan's defense ministry said was not conducive to China's international image. The United States is Taiwan's most important international backer and arms supplier, despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties. Taiwan has complained of repeated Chinese military activity nearby over the last three years or so as Beijing seeks to pressure Taipei to accept Chinese sovereignty.</p>

<p>Today's <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4250452" target="_blank">paper of the day</a> is The Copyright Claims Board: Good News or Bad News for Communication Scholars?, written by Patricia Aufderheide and Aram Sinnreich. This paper explores the implications of the U.S. Copyright Claims Board (CCB), created in 2020, for communication scholars. The authors surveyed communication and Internet scholars to assess their willingness to take risks when challenged for fair use of copyrighted material. They found that the CCB may not serve its stated purpose due to scholars’ fear of legal entanglements, as well as their inability to protect their work in this venue. The paper concludes that the nascent CCB should be closely monitored by communication and Internet scholars.</p>
