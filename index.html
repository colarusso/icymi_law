Greetings, my name is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidcolarusso.com" target="_blank">David Colarusso</a>.
I'm the co-director of Suffolk University Law School's
<a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/" target="_blank">Legal Innovation &amp; Technology (LIT) Lab</a>.
With one foot in law and the other in tech, I really want the open web to thrive. So
I created <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/icymilaw.org" target="_blank">a bot</a> 
(<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/icymilaw.org" target="_blank">@icymilaw.org</a>) 
and this site to help folks discover great law-themed content while showing off what one 
can do with sufficiently open protocols. <i>Note, the number of fire emoji represent how many standard deviations
more popular a link is than the average link observed in its category.</i>

<h2>AI Paper-like Links</h2><p>
A collection of links shared recently¹¹ on Bluesky 
that look like they point to papers on AI,¹² 
sorted by popularity. Wondering why this section is on a site about the law? 
Well, I teach a course on <a href="https://lawrpg.org/2024/ai-and-the-law/" target="_blank">AI & the Law</a>,
and it turns out that understanding 
this stuff is super important to figuring out what the law might have to 
say. So, I figured since I was sharing lists, I might as well share this one too.

<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10247" target="_blank">Strategic Integration of Artificial Intelligence in the C-Suite: The Role of the Chief AI Officer</a>&nbsp; <font size="-1"></font></br>The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into corporate strategy has become a pivotal focus for organizations aiming to maintain a competitive advantage in the digital age. As AI reshapes business operations and drives innovation, the need for specialized leadership to effectively manage these changes becomes increasingly apparent. In this paper, I explore the role of the Chief AI Officer (CAIO) within the C-suite, emphasizing the necessity of this position for successful AI strategy, integration, and governance. I analyze future scenarios based on current trends in three key areas: the AI Economy, AI Organization, and Competition in the Age of AI. These explorations lay the foundation for identifying the antecedents (environmental, structural, and strategic factors) that justify the inclusion of a CAIO in top management teams. This sets the stage for a comprehensive examination of the CAIO's role and the broader implications of AI leadership. This paper advances the discussion on AI leadership by providing a rationale for the strategic integration of AI at the executive level and examining the role of the Chief AI Officer within organizations.</li>
