Greetings, my name is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidcolarusso.com" target="_blank">David Colarusso</a>.
I'm the co-director of Suffolk University Law School's
<a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/" target="_blank">Legal Innovation &amp; Technology (LIT) Lab</a>.
With one foot in law and the other in tech, I really want the open web to thrive. So
I created <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/icymilaw.org" target="_blank">a bot</a> 
(<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/icymilaw.org" target="_blank">@icymilaw.org</a>) 
and this site to help folks discover great law-themed content while showing off what one 
can do with sufficiently open protocols. <i>Note, the number of fire emoji represent how many standard deviations
more popular a link is than the average link observed in its category.</i>

<p>
If you like these, you'll ❤️ this 
<a href="https://myrssalgo.org/" target="_blank">open source client-side algorithmically-driven RSS reader</a>.
