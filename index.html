Greetings, my name is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidcolarusso.com" target="_blank">David Colarusso</a>.
I'm the co-director of Suffolk University Law School's
<a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/" target="_blank">Legal Innovation &amp; Technology (LIT) Lab</a>.
With one foot in law and the other in tech, I really want the open web to thrive. So
I created <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/icymilaw.org" target="_blank">a bot</a> 
(<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/icymilaw.org" target="_blank">@icymilaw.org</a>) 
and this site to help folks discover great law-themed content while showing off what one 
can do with sufficiently open protocols. <i>Note, the number of fire emoji represent how many standard deviations
more popular a link is than the average link observed in its category.</i>

<h2>AI Paper-like Links</h2><p>
A collection of links shared recently¹¹ on Bluesky 
that look like they point to papers on AI,¹² 
sorted by popularity. Wondering why this section is on a site about the law? 
Well, I teach a course on <a href="https://lawrpg.org/2024/ai-and-the-law/" target="_blank">AI & the Law</a>,
and it turns out that understanding 
this stuff is super important to figuring out what the law might have to 
say. So, I figured since I was sharing lists, I might as well share this one too.

<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21860" target="_blank">Butter-Bench: Evaluating LLM Controlled Robots for Practical Intelligence</a><sup>&dagger;</sup>&nbsp; <font size="-1"></font></br>We present Butter-Bench, a benchmark evaluating large language model (LLM) controlled robots for practical intelligence, defined as the ability to navigate the messiness of the physical world. Current state-of-the-art robotic systems use a hierarchical architecture with LLMs in charge of high-level reasoning, and a Vision Language Action (VLA) model for low-level control. Butter-Bench evaluates the LLM part in isolation from the VLA. Although LLMs have repeatedly surpassed humans in evaluations requiring analytical intelligence, we find humans still outperform LLMs on Butter-Bench. The best LLMs score 40% on Butter-Bench, while the mean human score is 95%. LLMs struggled the most with multi-step spatial planning and social understanding. We also evaluate LLMs that are fine-tuned for embodied reasoning and conclude that this training does not improve their score on Butter-Bench.</li>
