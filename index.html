Greetings, my name is <a href="https://www.davidcolarusso.com/" target="_blank">David Colarusso</a>.
I'm the co-director of Suffolk University Law School's
<a href="https://suffolklitlab.org/" target="_blank">Legal Innovation &amp; Technology (LIT) Lab</a>.
With one foot in law and the other in tech, I really want the open web to thrive. So
I created <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/icymilaw.org" target="_blank">a bot</a> 
(<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/icymilaw.org" target="_blank">@icymilaw.org</a>) 
and this site to help folks discover great law-themed content while showing off what one 
can do with sufficiently open protocols. <i>Note, the number of fire emoji represent how many standard deviations
more popular a link is than the average link observed in its category.</i>

<h2>AI Paper-like Links</h2><p>
A collection of links shared recently¹¹ on Bluesky 
that look like they point to papers on AI,¹² 
sorted by popularity. Wondering why this section is on a site about the law? 
Well, I teach a course on <a href="https://lawrpg.org/2024/ai-and-the-law/" target="_blank">AI & the Law</a>,
and it turns out that understanding 
this stuff is super important to figuring out what the law might have to 
say. So, I figured since I was sharing lists, I might as well share this one too.

<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08872" target="_blank">Your Brain on ChatGPT: Accumulation of Cognitive Debt when Using an AI Assistant for Essay Writing Task</a><sup>&dagger;</sup>&nbsp; <font size="-1">🔥🔥</font></br>This study explores the neural and behavioral consequences of LLM-assisted essay writing. Participants were divided into three groups: LLM, Search Engine, and Brain-only (no tools). Each completed three sessions under the same condition. In a fourth session, LLM users were reassigned to Brain-only group (LLM-to-Brain), and Brain-only users were reassigned to LLM condition (Brain-to-LLM). A total of 54 participants took part in Sessions 1-3, with 18 completing session 4. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to assess cognitive load during essay writing, and analyzed essays using NLP, as well as scoring essays with the help from human teachers and an AI judge. Across groups, NERs, n-gram patterns, and topic ontology showed within-group homogeneity. EEG revealed significant differences in brain connectivity: Brain-only participants exhibited the strongest, most distributed networks; Search Engine users showed moderate engagement; and LLM users displayed the weakest connectivity. Cognitive activity scaled down in relation to external tool use. In session 4, LLM-to-Brain participants showed reduced alpha and beta connectivity, indicating under-engagement. Brain-to-LLM users exhibited higher memory recall and activation of occipito-parietal and prefrontal areas, similar to Search Engine users. Self-reported ownership of essays was the lowest in the LLM group and the highest in the Brain-only group. LLM users also struggled to accurately quote their own work. While LLMs offer immediate convenience, our findings highlight potential cognitive costs. Over four months, LLM users consistently underperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels. These results raise concerns about the long-term educational implications of LLM reliance and underscore the need for deeper inquiry into AI's role in learning.</li>
